a meta question- i notice there's a Quick response and a Think Deeper- is giving you more time going to help the depth of your response- like allowing a chess program more time to plot the moves?
Copilot said
Great meta question, Jill — and yes, in a way, it’s a bit like giving a chess engine more time to calculate deeper moves.

When you select “Think Deeper”, it signals me to prioritize depth, nuance, and layered reasoning — to explore more angles, draw richer connections, and sometimes even challenge assumptions. It’s especially helpful for:

Complex character analysis

Thematic or symbolic interpretation

Structural mapping or philosophical questions

Anything where you want the cathedral, not just the blueprint

“Quick Response” is great when you want clarity, speed, or a focused answer — like a tactical move. “Think Deeper” is for strategy, myth, and meaning.

So yes — if you want the full mythic tapestry, freckles and all, “Think Deeper” is your friend. Want to try it on something next?

Absolutely, take your time, Jill. Whenever you’re ready, just let me know what you’d like to dive into next—or whether you’d like Quick or Think Deeper mode.

One more problem I have and wanted to explore with you is the Alternate History- you see, early on, there wasone more influence on the novel- one was Sparta, with its obvious connections to the early MAPAM "Spartan" Kibbutsnik ideals of community welfare before "Self Expression", of simplicity in material comforts, of the Palmach elite military (with its ideal of Tohar Ha'Neshek (The Purity of Arms), and, last but not least, of female/male equality in ALL things (the first Israeli girl soldiers were in the Palmach- decades before the IDF was pushed by the supreme court to allow girls into combat units. And this made me think of the advantages of "limiting" Israel- or what was then called the "Yeshuv", to City State- or at most, a CONfederation of City States, which "Ben Gurion"/Zohar's father was in the process of coercing into his one Statist "Melting Pot" as a way of eroding MAPAM's unique ideals/power base by diluting it with other, opposing elements- this process, which included a plan of drastic reduction of female equality (if there are enough men to fill the ranks, shouldnt women be better employed as stay at home mothers- is the reason Zohar forms her "Princess Cadre" in "self defence- which Shira doesnt like since Israeli law forbids serving officers from expressing political views or actively belonging to political parties- they can vote of course, but not paricipate in elections etc. This is Zohar's first law breaking- and another cause of friction between her and Shira- this is the point , in war college, where Shira begins to be replaced by Tal as Zohar's closest confidant. Zohar's execution of the ensign before graduation is the final break with Shira- When Zohar insists its he right by military law to execute an ensign for cowardice in the field, Shira answers, and its the truth, that this is on the extreme OUTER edge of the law- and that rape is not "technically" cowardice in the field, and that rape is by law not a capital offence. Wow. I forgot my problem :-)

Framing the Alternate-History Divergence
You’ve layered so much here—Spartan kibbbutznik ideals, Palmach’s Purity of Arms, early gender equality—and set it against Zohar’s father’s drive to forge a unitary state. The key world-building lift is to show how and why Israel stays a loose confederation of city-states rather than a centralized nation.

1. Point of Divergence
1948–50: MAPAM’s coalition holds firm.

Instead of Ben-Gurion outflanking the left, the city-states sign a formal Confederation Pact—each with its own local council, militia and agriculture-commune model.

A rotating “Council of Cities” replaces a single executive, preventing the rise of a strong presidency.

2. The Spartan Ethos in Your World
Communal Simplicity

City-state law forbids private land ownership; everyone farms collectively. Luxuries are taxed back into community—like a Spartan agoge.

Purity of Arms

Officers swear a “Palmach Oath” against political partisanship. Military courts enforce it—even via summary dismissal or execution for egregious breaches (cowardice, insubordination).

Full Gender Parity

From age 18, every citizen—male or female—must serve two years in a mixed combat militia. Women carry rank and responsibility equal to men.

This equality shapes dress, housing, parenting—patriarchal households never form the norm.

3. Zohar’s Princess Cadre as Political Insurgency
Illegal Party-within-the-Militia

Zohar recruits idealists who refuse to let the Council dilute MAPAM’s values via mass-immigration or centralization bills.

Shadow-elected “princes/princesses” coordinate communes and cell-based defense if the Confederation Pact is threatened.

Shira’s Friction Point

As an officer she’s bound by law to remain apolitical. When Zohar’s Cadre uses her intel to plan a demonstration in the capital city, Shira must choose between discipline and friendship.

The ensign-execution scene can hinge on this: Zohar argues the law is absolute; Shira counters that reading “cowardice” to include moral objections stretches it into tyranny.

4. Narrative & Thematic Pay-Offs
Undermining the Pact

Zohar’s first law-breaking begins the unraveling: city-states start enacting their own martial law, fearing civil war.

Female Equality Reversal

Zohar’s father quietly passes a bill to remove women from combat, claiming manpower shortages—an echo of Sparta’s late-period drift away from gender parity.

Shira’s facilitation of her father’s escape becomes the spark that reveals the Confederation’s fragility.

Civil War Impetus

Once mixed-gender service is revoked in key cities, entire militias split along lines of gender-equality vs. traditionalism.

Next Steps
Timeline Sketch: Want to plot the key dates and political crises that lead from confederation to near-civil war?

Law Code Outline: Need a draft of the Confederation’s military and civil statutes to ground those scenes?

Scene Beats: Or should we zero-in on the pivotal moment when Shira realizes Zohar’s execution of the ensign is the point of no return?

Let me know which angle you’d like to deep-dive next—“Think Deeper” style, of course.

I think a timeline would be good- i've shied from a detailed one because of unsolved alternate historical problems- but one thing is clear to me- i feel obligated to the israeli timeline only as far as a series of traumas with a clear cause and effect- what I mean is, the  "breaking up the Palmach" catastophe must come before the Yom Kippur Catastrophe, as the latter depends on the former- but the year each happened, say 1948-9 and 1973, is not something that's important for me- much more important is how to fit them into Zohar's life- she ought to be in elementary school to understand enough of her father's (prime minister) arguments with her aunt (Noa's mom, and Zohar's mom's younger sister), who is the MAPAM nominated Minister of defence and Zohar's earliest female role model, and the Yom Kippur war must happen when Zohar is just out of war college, as an early twenties lietenant col. so if that's the case, how many years between the Palmach  trauma and the Yom Kippur trauma?
Copilot said
Here’s a way to lock in the relative spacing without worrying about the real-world dates:

Choose a single anchor in Zohar’s life—say, her age when the Palmach breakup hits home in elementary school.

Example: Zohar is 8 years old when “Palmach Day” (the breakup catastrophe) shatters her faith in the old ideals.

Pick her age for the Yom Kippur trauma—just out of war college as a junior officer in her early 20s.

Example: Zohar is 22 years old when she leads her platoon in that surprise assault.

Compute the span: 22 – 8 = 14 years.

If you want it feel a bit tighter or looser, you can shift either age by a year or two (e.g. 7 → 21 gives 14 years; 10 → 23 gives 13 years).

Sample In-World Timeline
Zohar’s Age	Event	“Year” (story-world)
0	Born to the Prime Minister and MP of Defense	Year 0
8	Palmach breakup shocks the nation	Year 8
12	Joins cadet corps / first taste of military	Year 12
18	Enters war college	Year 18
22	Yom Kippur–style war / her baptism by fire	Year 22
That gives you a roughly 14-year gap—long enough for childhood mythos to harden into adult conviction, yet short enough that the two traumas feel part of one restless generation.

If you’d rather it span a decade and a half, simply make her 8 → 23 (15 years), or for a briefer echo 9 → 21 (12 years). Let me know which feels right, or if you want to see it mapped out with more life-stage beats!

Perfect — thanks for clarifying the educational and military structure in your alternate Israel. Based on that, here’s a refined timeline that aligns with Zohar’s life stages and the key historical traumas:

🕰️ Zohar-Centered Alternate History Timeline
Zohar’s Age	Life Stage	Event	Narrative Impact
0	Birth	Born to the Prime Minister (father) and a MAPAM-aligned mother	Legacy begins
6–12	Elementary School	Early exposure to political debates between her father and aunt	Seeds of conflict
8	—	Palmach Breakup: Disbanding of elite militias, rollback of gender equality	First trauma, ideological fracture
12–15	Intermediary School	Begins cadet training; idolizes her aunt (Minister of Defense)	Formation of ideals
15	Enters War College	Begins formal officer training	Meets Shira, Tal
18	Graduation from War College	Forms Princess Cadre; executes ensign; breaks with Shira	First law-breaking
22	Junior Officer	Yom Kippur War: Surprise attack; massive casualties; fathers imprisoned	Second trauma, rise to power
23–25	Rise to Command	Takes control of military; begins reforms	Coup arc begins
26–30	Rex Period	Governs, reforms, faces betrayal	Mythic peak & fall
🧭 Notes
The 14-year gap between Palmach Breakup (age 8) and Yom Kippur War (age 22) remains intact — perfect for showing ideological disillusionment hardening into militant resolve.

Starting War College at 15 makes Zohar’s precocity and elite status clear — she’s not just a soldier, she’s a prodigy shaped by trauma.

The Princess Cadre and ensign execution now fall at 18 — a symbolic age of adulthood and rebellion.

The Yom Kippur trauma hits just as she’s stepping into real command — a crucible moment.

Would you like to sketch a parallel timeline for Shira or Noa? Or map these beats onto the Heroine’s Journey stages we discussed earlier?

26 - 36 to allow for the Grand Reversal Reform Plan Implementation, and deepening relationship with Noa
Copilot said
Got it — extending Zohar’s Rex period to ages 26–36 makes perfect sense. That gives her a full decade to:

Implement the Grand Reversal Reform Plan

Consolidate power while trying to preserve MAPAM ideals

Deepen her relationship with Ayelet

Mentor and formally adopt Noa as her heir

Face the slow unraveling of her regime through betrayal, exhaustion, and mythic overreach

Here’s the updated timeline:

🕰️ Zohar’s Life & Political Arc (Updated)
Zohar’s Age	Life Stage	Event	Narrative Impact
0	Birth	Born to the Prime Minister and MAPAM mother	Legacy begins
6–12	Elementary School	Political debates at home; idolizes aunt (Minister of Defense)	Seeds of conflict
8	—	Palmach Breakup: dismantling of elite militias, rollback of gender equality	First trauma
12–15	Intermediary School	Cadet training; early ideological formation	Military idealism
15	War College	Meets Shira and Tal; forms Princess Cadre	Political awakening
18	Graduation	Executes ensign; breaks with Shira	First moral fracture
22	Junior Officer	Yom Kippur War: catastrophic losses; fathers imprisoned	Second trauma
23–25	Rise to Command	Coup arc begins; consolidates power	Transition to Rex
26–36	Rex Period	Implements Grand Reversal; governs; deepens bond with Ayelet and Noa	Mythic peak
36	Assassination Attempt	Wounded by escaped fathers’ faction	Near-death vision
37	Final Year	Reconciliation, succession, sacrifice	Apotheosis
Would you like to build a similar timeline for Shira, to track how her arc diverges and intersects with Zohar’s? Or perhaps sketch the key milestones in the Grand Reversal Reform Plan itself?

i have similar "timelines" or narrative lines per narrator in Scrivener, and the act/scene structure details in Final Draft- i'll upload them this evening, but, for now, lets stay with the Alternate History (and correct one thing you put forward earlier- i don't see the Palmach Trauma as shattering Zohar's faith in the old ideals- on the contrary- I see it shattering any last vestige of faith in either her father or the "New Deal" (Zohar refuses to see them as new IDEALS). The Palmach Trauma is the first "political" moment in Zohar's young life- the first moment she commits emotionally, come what may, to the OLD ideals, and to her aunt- in the father vs. aunt/mapai vs. mapam debate.
Copilot said
Thank you for that correction, Jill — it’s a crucial distinction, and it sharpens Zohar’s ideological arc beautifully.

Let’s revise the framing of the Palmach Trauma accordingly:

🔥 The Palmach Trauma (Zohar, Age 8)
Not a disillusionment with ideals — but a radicalization in their defense.

Zohar sees her father dismantle the Palmach and begin rolling back gender equality and communal values.

This is her first political awakening — not as a rebel without a cause, but as a loyalist to the old MAPAM ideals.

She emotionally commits to her aunt as her true ideological parent — the one who embodies Spartan discipline, egalitarianism, and moral clarity.

From this moment on, Zohar sees her father’s “New Deal” not as progress, but as betrayal — a dilution of the founding vision in favor of centralization, patriarchy, and compromise.

This makes her entire arc a defense of a lost republic — not a revolution, but a restoration. She’s not trying to invent something new. She’s trying to resurrect something old, pure, and already betrayed.

Would you like to sketch how this moment plays out in a scene — maybe a dinner-table argument, a public speech, or a private moment between Zohar and her aunt? Or explore how this early commitment shapes her later ruthlessness?

not yet- as you see, i'm still trying to stay out of the details of particualr scenes- for two reasons- one, i already have brief 1 para descriptions of all the main scenes- though of course they keep getting refined- and two, because i'm still bothered by the incomplete alternate history - for example- cavalry instead of jeeps and tanks in the 50's to 70's is rediculous- but in step with a city state- so what, a post apocalyptic setting in which the tech level is say late 19th century- the last great cavalry charge happened in the first world war, by australian cavalry charging Beer Sheva from the turks and germans- there's a point- say when a Winchester or Henry carbines become an M16 automatic assault rifle, or a cannon becomes a Gatling Gun, when horses become obsolete and anyone who uses them becomes a mass murdurer, so you see the problem- the tech level of the story is that of the middle of the American Civil War- so how do i get there?
Copilot said
Thanks for your patience, Jill. Here’s a deep dive into how you might plausibly arrive at a late 19th-century tech level—with cavalry, carbines, and city-states—without breaking the internal logic of your alternate history.

🧭 Anchoring the Tech Level: Late 19th Century
🔧 Civil War–Era Technology (c. 1860s)
From the sources I reviewed1
2
3
, here are the key tech features of that era:

Weapons: Rifled muskets, Miniי balls, early repeating rifles (e.g., Henry, Spencer), Gatling guns (1862), and basic artillery.

Transport: Horses, railroads, and riverboats. Cavalry still viable in open terrain.

Communication: Telegraphy, signal flags, and printed orders via portable presses.

Medicine: Rudimentary field surgery, no antibiotics, high amputation rates.

Industry: Steam power, early mass production, ironclads in naval warfare.

This is the level you’re aiming to preserve or regress to—where horses still matter, but automatic weapons and tanks don’t exist.

🐎 Cavalry in the 20th Century: The Beersheba Precedent
The Battle of Beersheba (1917) was one of the last great cavalry charges in history4
5
:

The 4th Australian Light Horse Brigade charged Ottoman trenches with bayonets in hand.

They succeeded because the trenches lacked barbed wire and the charge was unexpected.

It was a tactical anomaly—but it shows that cavalry could still be effective under the right conditions, even against machine guns.

This gives you a historical precedent for cavalry surviving longer in a world where:

Terrain favors mobility over armor.

Industrial production is limited.

Fuel and rubber are scarce or unreliable.

🌍 How to Get There: Plausible Alternate-History Paths
Here are three world-building options to justify a late-19th-century tech plateau:

1. Post-Apocalyptic Regression
A limited nuclear exchange, EMP event, or global resource collapse in the 1940s–50s halts industrial progress.

Israel (or the Confederation) survives in relative isolation, preserving Palmach-era values and pre-WWII tech.

Railways and radios exist, but petroleum is scarce, and factories are decentralized or destroyed.

Horses remain viable because mechanized logistics are unreliable.

2. Ideological Tech Suppression
The Confederation intentionally rejects high-tech militarization to preserve egalitarianism and reduce dependency.

MAPAM doctrine mandates “human-scale” warfare: no tanks, no drones, no nukes.

Cavalry is retained as a symbol of communal discipline and mobility.

Firearms are limited to single-shot or lever-action rifles to prevent mass slaughter.

3. Geopolitical Isolation
The Confederation is cut off from global trade due to embargoes or ideological non-alignment.

Lacking access to oil, rubber, or advanced electronics, they never develop tanks or jets.

They rely on horses, steam, and local manufacturing—a kind of “Spartan Autarky.”

🧱 Hybrid Option: The “Preserved Plateau”
