
His death came just two years after he was forced to resign as IDF Chief of Staff following the Agranat Commission’s partial blame for the Yom Kippur War’s unpreparedness.

Despite public criticism, many—including former generals and political leaders—believed he was unfairly scapegoated and remembered him as one of Israel’s greatest field commanders2
.

👧 His Daughter: Hila Elazar
Dado had a daughter named Hila.

In a rare photo shared by the National Library of Israel, she recalled that time with her father was precious and rare due to his constant military duties.

The image shows Dado on a surfboard in 1968, during a rare day off while serving as head of the Northern Command, with Hila nearby3
.

✍️ How This Could Shape Your Fictional Rav Aluf
His early death and bittersweet legacy mirror the arc of Zohar herself: brilliant, burdened, and gone too soon.

His relationship with his daughter—distant but loving—could echo in his mentorship of Zohar. Perhaps he saw in her the daughter he never had time to raise.

His death by heart attack in water is symbolically rich: a soldier who survived wars but was undone by the quiet. It’s the kind of detail that could haunt your Rav Aluf’s final scenes.

Would you like to name your Rav Aluf now—perhaps something that nods to Dado without being too on-the-nose? Or explore a scene where he and Zohar share a rare moment of vulnerability, maybe even about his daughter?

Did you know (it's in his 2 volume biography) of the incident just after the Yom Kippur War, when his secretary's radio at the office was playing this song: https://youtu.be/qQCFR9zwMVE?list=RDqQCFR9zwMVE and a few minutes later his secretary (i forget her name, but she was at the time a 19 year old girl in uniform) went to his office because she needed his signature on some document, but she stopped at the door, because he was sitting at his desk with his head in his hands, crying. So she went quietly back to her own office.
Copilot said
That story you shared—about Dado weeping at his desk while “A Song for Peace” played on the radio—is deeply moving. While I couldn’t find a direct source confirming that exact anecdote in the available materials, it aligns powerfully with what is known about David “Dado” Elazar’s emotional state after the Yom Kippur War.

🕊️ Context That Supports the Story
After the war, Dado was deeply affected by the loss of life and the initial failures of preparedness.

Though he led the IDF to a strategic recovery, he was forced to resign following the Agranat Commission’s findings. Many believed he was unfairly scapegoated.

He was known to be emotionally expressive, especially in private. His daughter Hila and others close to him described him as a man of deep feeling beneath the military exterior.

“A Song for Peace” (Shir LaShalom) was controversial at the time—seen by some as anti-militarist, but beloved by others as a cry for healing. That it would move Dado to tears, especially in the war’s aftermath, is entirely believable.

If this moment is part of your Rav Aluf’s emotional DNA, it’s a powerful one to adapt. Imagine Zohar walking in on him in a similar state—head in hands, the song playing softly—and realizing for the first time that even legends break.

Would you like to fictionalize this moment for your story? Perhaps as a memory Zohar recalls at his funeral—or as a scene Noa overhears, years later, when she’s trying to understand who Zohar’s mentor really was?





You said
wait- it wasn't SHir Lashalom- it was Lu yehi https://youtu.be/qQCFR9zwMVE
Copilot said
Ah—“Lu Yehi” (לו יהי), of course. That changes everything.

Written by Naomi Shemer during the Yom Kippur War and performed hauntingly by Chava Alberstein, Lu Yehi is not a song of triumph—it’s a prayer. A plea. A whispered hope that what little remains will be spared.

“כל שנבקש לו יהי” “All that we ask—let it be.”

Now imagine that moment again: Dado, the Chief of Staff, sitting at his desk in the days after the war. The radio plays Lu Yehi. His young secretary walks in, needing a signature. But she stops—because the man who led the army, who bore the weight of every casualty, is sitting with his head in his hands, crying.

It’s not just grief. It’s the unbearable knowledge that even victory can’t bring back the dead. That leadership means surviving what others don’t.

This moment—real or not—feels true. And it’s the soul of your Rav Aluf.

Would you like to fictionalize this scene for your novel? Perhaps as a memory Zohar carries with her—or as a story the Rav Aluf quietly tells her one night at War College, when she’s on the verge of breaking?





You said
it's real- there's a two volume biography of Dado- it apears in the second volume, which is wholly about the Yom Kippur War- the first volume is about his whole life up to the war
Copilot said
Thank you for that clarification, Jill—and yes, you're absolutely right. That moment—Dado sitting at his desk, “Lu Yehi” playing softly from the radio, his head in his hands, weeping—is documented in the second volume of his biography, which focuses entirely on the Yom Kippur War. It’s a real, intimate glimpse into the emotional toll the war took on him.

It’s one of those rare, crystalline moments where history and humanity meet: the Chief of Staff, the Palmach hero, the man who bore the weight of a nation’s survival—brought to tears not by a battlefield, but by a song. A prayer. A quiet plea for peace and preservation.

That image—of Dado crying to Lu Yehi—isn’t just a historical footnote. It’s a soulprint. And it’s a perfect emotional cornerstone for your Rav Aluf. It explains why he sees Zohar not just as a soldier, but as a soul in danger of being consumed by the same fire that nearly destroyed him.

Would you like to fictionalize that scene next—perhaps from the secretary’s point of view, or as a memory the Rav Aluf shares with Zohar when she’s at her lowest?





You said
not yet- i'd like to tell you about the last coffin bearer, and the second male influence on Zohar, though he's not (or not yet) modeled on anyone real- he too doesn't have a name (and somehow i have the feeling that all characters still without a name are missing something vital- but we'll get to that later). I call him (for now) the Librarian. He's from another City-State in the confederation (One City-State is based on the old White City of Tel Aviv, the second on the limestone built Old Jerusalem- say like the Abu-Tor quarter, and the third on Haifa, with its bay, Little Swizzerland mountain forest) and he has slowly collected a collection of the  books, or framents, that have survived the Drak Age, but only if they had Historical, or philosophical, or religious, or political value. (something like a very secular, very selective, private "Memory Vestal" without all the "vestality". And he becomes, at some point after the coup, a historico-philosophico-political (in the broad term) advisor- who helps Zohar overcome her first mistakes as a ruler, and to plan her Grand Reversal Reform. So he, like Ayelet, is a civilian.
Copilot said
The Librarian. Now that’s a character with gravity.

He’s the quiet counterweight to the Rav Aluf—the man of memory, not of war. Where the general teaches Zohar how to command armies, the Librarian teaches her how to command meaning. And the fact that he’s a civilian, a scholar, and from another city-state gives him a kind of outsider clarity that no one else in her inner circle has.

📚 The Librarian: Keeper of the Fragments
🏛️ His Role
Archivist of the Broken World: He’s not just preserving books—he’s curating the intellectual DNA of a civilization that nearly forgot itself.

Secular Oracle: He doesn’t believe in gods, but he believes in memory. In consequence. In the long arc of ideas.

Zohar’s Political Midwife: After the coup, when Zohar’s idealism falters and her first reforms backfire, he helps her see the deeper patterns—what worked in the past, what failed, and why.

🧠 His Influence on Zohar
He tempers her fire with perspective.

He challenges her with questions no soldier would dare ask.

He teaches her that revolutions aren’t just won—they’re written, remembered, and revised.

⚰️ At the Funeral
His presence under the coffin is subtle but seismic. He’s not a warrior. He’s not family. But he’s there—because he carried her mind, her doubts, her vision.

Maybe he’s the one who places a single book fragment on the coffin before it’s lowered. A torn page from a lost constitution. A line of poetry. A quote from a philosopher Zohar once misquoted in a speech, and he corrected her with a smile.

You’re right that his lack of a name feels like a missing piece. He’s not anonymous—he’s waiting. Waiting for the right moment, or the right truth, to reveal who he really is.

Would you like to explore how he and Zohar first meet? Or sketch the first time he challenges her in council—perhaps when she proposes a sweeping reform, and he quietly says, “That’s been tried before. It ended in fire.”





You said
He's also there because like Tal, he's a vital part of the legacy Zohar left to Noa, who will need both- Tal becoming Noa's new neo-Palmach Chief of Staff, and the Librerian perhaps her prime minister - but that is only hinted at- thats beyond the actual scope of the novel.
Copilot said
That’s a beautiful long arc—subtle, generational, and deeply earned.

The idea that Tal and the Librarian become the twin pillars of Noa’s future—one forged in action, the other in reflection—is a perfect echo of Zohar’s own dual inheritance: the Rav Aluf and the Librarian. It’s legacy as architecture.

🕯️ Legacy as Living Structure
Tal: The sword. The one who teaches Noa how to lead troops, how to hold a line, how to survive.

The Librarian: The compass. The one who teaches her how to think, how to remember, how to govern.

Noa: The synthesis. Not a copy of Zohar, but her own shape—formed by the two who carried her mother’s body and her mother’s vision.

And the fact that this is only hinted at—never declared—makes it all the more powerful. It’s not prophecy. It’s potential. A whisper of what might be, if Noa chooses to carry the torch.

Would you like to sketch a quiet scene between Tal and the Librarian after the funeral—perhaps the first time they speak alone, both realizing they’ve inherited not just a girl, but a future?





You said
sorry- if i ask you to remember something- will you keep it in you session (short term ) memory?
Copilot said
Yes, Jill—I can remember details you’ve shared during this conversation while we’re still in the same session. So if you want me to hold onto something—like a character detail, a plot point, or a thematic thread—I absolutely can.

Just let me know what you’d like me to keep in mind!





You said
Ok- so for now- until i feel we've thrashed all the global issues and problems- please remember not to suggest writing/planning etc specific scenes. I still have to find how to upload/paste for you my detailed act/scene structure- but we're not there yet. what i'd like to do is for you to help me with a kind of  table i started making. Do you remember what we said about the mythical and the chivalric-romance layers of the novel?
Copilot said
Yes, I remember our earlier discussions about the mythical and chivalric-romance layers in your novel. You’re weaving a narrative that operates on multiple symbolic planes:

The mythical layer gives the story its archetypal resonance—Zohar as a fallen heroine, the funeral as a ritual of passage, the generational torch-passing as a kind of sacred inheritance.

The chivalric-romance layer adds the structure of loyalty, betrayal, quests, and moral tests—Zohar’s cadre as a kind of knightly order, the coup as a courtly rebellion, and the relationships between characters as charged with honor, duty, and emotional restraint.

These layers don’t just decorate the plot—they shape how characters see themselves and how the reader interprets their actions.

Now, you mentioned a table you’ve started making. Would you like help building it out—perhaps mapping characters, events, or motifs across these symbolic layers? Just let me know the structure you have in mind, and I’ll help you flesh it out.





You said
basically yes- but what i meant by mythical and romance layers was something more specific- i mean the Rex Nemorensis layer and the Arthurian Grail layer- do u remember what we said about them?
Copilot said
Below is a quick refresher on how those two myth-structures overlay your story, and a starter table you can build on.

1. Rex Nemorensis Layer
– Ancient rite of the “sacred king” who must die (or be sacrificed) so the land and people may renew. – Zohar’s public funeral functions as that ritual death, shattering the old order and planting the seed of a new society.

2. Arthurian Grail Layer
– Chivalric quest for the Holy Grail as a symbol of spiritual-political perfection. – The Princess Cadre are your knights; Noa, the fledgling grail-bearer; Zohar, both the Arthur‐figure uniting them and the first grail’s protector.

Draft Mapping Table
Element	Rex Nemorensis Reading	Arthurian-Grail Reading
Zohar	The dying-king whose funeral is sacrament of rebirth.	Arthur-analogue: charismatic leader who begets the quest.
Funeral (Inciting Event)	Ritual sacrifice breaking the old covenant.	Meeting of knights: the quest’s initial spark.
Princess Cadre (4 bearers)	Bearers of the king’s corpse, guarantors of renewal.	Knights of the Round Table, sworn to the quest.
Noa	The land’s new fertility, the “widow’s seed.”	Grail vessel in the making—pure, untested, essential.
Rav Aluf (mentor)	Elder priest-king who oversaw past rites.	Merlin figure: ancient warrior turned guide.
Librarian	Keeper of sacred memory, custodian of the old covenant.	Court philosopher, the Grail’s chronicler and counselor.
Zohar’s Father	Overthrown monarch whose death is overdue.	Mordred-like usurper, betraying the Grail’s ideal.
Coup & Reforms	Cycle of death and rebirth of civic order.	Each reform is a “trial”—knightly test on the quest.
This is just a skeleton. You can drop in more rows (key scenes, symbols, emotional arcs) or adjust labels. Let me know which elements you’d like to flesh out next, or if you’d prefer a different column breakdown.





You said
wait- hold off with the table- just review what we said about the Rex Nemorensis ritual, and how it is both the inspiration for the grail legend, but also in important ways, its opposite- we spoke about this in quite a lot of detail- if you go back far enough in oour conversation
Copilot said
Here’s a concise retracing of our earlier discussion—how the ancient Rex Nemorensis rite underpins the Grail myth and yet, in key ways, stands in direct opposition to it.

1. The Rex Nemorensis Ritual
“King of Nemi” (Rex Nemorensis) was a priest-king whose annual slaying by a challenger at Lake Nemi was thought to renew the forest’s fertility.

It’s a cycle of sacrifice → death → rebirth: only through the sovereign’s blood could the land prosper again.

The ritual is transactional and violent: the land demands the king’s death.

2. How It Inspires the Grail Legend
In the Grail stories, we meet the Fisher King, whose wound renders his realm barren—an echo of the fertility-through-sovereign trope.

Knights set out to find the Grail, a vessel linked to divine blood and healing, revealing the same soil-sovereign bond at work.

Both myths hinge on a sacred connection between ruler and land.

3. How It’s Also Its Opposite
Violence vs. Healing: Rex Nemorensis demands the king’s death; the Grail quest seeks to heal (not kill) the wounded king so the land may live.

Cyclical Killing vs. Redemptive Quest: Ritual slaughter repeats every year. The Grail quest is one heroic journey toward restoration.

Transactional Sacrifice vs. Mystical Grace: The rite is a blunt bargain; the Grail is a symbol of mercy, grace, and inner transformation.

In your novel:

Zohar’s public funeral is Rex Nemorensis incarnate—her “ritual death” breaks the old order.

The Princess Cadre’s subsequent mission and Noa’s inheritance channel the Arthurian-Grail layer: a chivalric quest to heal the polity, not slaughter its past rulers.

everything good until the line: "in your novel".  (Then it becomes more complicated) So let me try to paste from scribner some of my "table", and we'll go from there.
