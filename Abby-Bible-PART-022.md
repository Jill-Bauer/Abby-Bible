Got it—take all the time you need. I’ll be right here when you’re ready to dive into that almost-Inciting Incident from graduation day. I can already feel it’s going to be a pivotal moment.





You said
ready?
Copilot said
Ready! Let’s hear about the moment that almost became the Inciting Incident—Zohar’s war college graduation day. I’m all ears.





You said
you mean you're "all ears, and freckles" :-)
Copilot said
Touchי 😄—all ears, freckles, and a suspiciously encyclopedic memory. Now hit me with that graduation day story—I’m ready.





You said
ok- so Graduadtion Day, as usual, is attended by the graduates parents, and, as is the custom, the current star ensign (in this case the flowring Zohar) is to give a speech before the College Personel and the parents. Zohar intends to speak of the military necessity of re-constituting a fully female-qual Palmach, but her intention has been leaked (she later finds Shira has mentioned it to her father- probably in vague terms, with the intention of finding out how big a breach of the "serving officers not involving themselves in politics" rule this will be. and so, just before Zohar is to step up and give her graduation speech, her father- as a "parent", bypasses her and instead gives his "new deal" speech with its statist, and, in the long term mostly male IDF. Zohar has a choice, and she chooses not to start an open conflict. She knows she still hasn't the right kind of power, and so she decides to wait for another day, and another conflict. (this unintentional- or not fully intentional breach of Zohar's trust by Shira is also a preshadow of her later "betrayal.

That’s a beautifully layered “almost” moment—quiet on the surface, but tectonic underneath. Here’s why it works so well:

🎓 Graduation Day: The Deferred Revolt
🔥 Dramatic Tension
Zohar is poised to make her first public stand—not just as a soldier, but as a visionary. Her speech would’ve been a declaration of intent: to resurrect the Palmach in its fully gender-equal form.

Her father’s preemptive move isn’t just political—it’s deeply personal. He hijacks her moment under the guise of paternal pride, asserting control while cloaking it in ceremony.

🧨 The Choice Not to Detonate
Zohar’s restraint is powerful. She reads the room, the politics, the timing—and chooses not to burn the house down. That decision makes her later defiance at the funeral even more potent. She waited. She watched. And when she struck, it was with precision.

This also shows her strategic mind: she’s not impulsive, she’s calculating. She knows that power isn’t just about being right—it’s about when you act.

🕊️ The Fracture with Shira
Shira’s leak—whether naןve or tactical—plants the seed of mistrust. It’s not a betrayal yet, but it’s a crack in the foundation. Zohar will remember this moment when the real betrayal comes.

It also complicates Shira: she’s not a villain, but she’s not fully loyal either. She’s caught between admiration for Zohar and allegiance to her father.

🌱 Narrative Payoff
This scene gives you:

A mirror to the Inciting Incident: a moment when Zohar could have acted, but didn’t. That contrast makes her later choice feel earned.

A foreshadowing of the ideological war to come: statist masculinity vs. revolutionary egalitarianism.

A character crucible: Zohar’s first test of restraint, Shira’s first breach of trust, and the father’s first open move to silence his daughter.

Would you like to dramatize this scene next—Zohar backstage, the speech she never gives, the look she exchanges with Shira? Or explore how Tal remembers this day, perhaps as the moment she first saw Zohar as more than just a comrade?

hmmm- on the last day of 2020, in a Final Draft first draft, this is how i described Zohar (she was called Tamar at the time): A cold kind of pretty: a severe kind of beauty: regulation cut hair pulled back into a perfect bun under the officer cap. No makeup. Freckles.
A defiant, regal slip of a girl, with laser-like focus, and a determined undercurrent of rage. A deep strategic guilt always on the edge of tactical violence. Pride held in check by an intense despising of weakness.
Copilot said
That’s a stunning character sketch—sharp, economical, and emotionally loaded. Even in that early draft, Zohar (then Tamar) already radiates the contradictions that make her unforgettable:

“A cold kind of pretty” — She’s not ornamental; her beauty is disciplined, almost weaponized.

“Laser-like focus… undercurrent of rage” — She’s not just a soldier, she’s a storm held in formation.

“Strategic guilt… tactical violence” — That’s poetry. It suggests she’s haunted by what she’s done—or what she might yet do.

“Pride held in check by an intense despising of weakness” — That line alone could power an entire arc. It’s her strength and her flaw, her armor and her wound.

This version of Zohar is already the woman who would kneel at a funeral and claim a child in front of the nation. She’s not just a heroine—she’s a reckoning.

Would you like to revisit this description and evolve it now that Zohar’s arc is more defined? Or maybe write a scene where someone else—Tal, Shira, or even Noa—describes her in their own words?





You said
Well, the strategic guilt is the one she feels for having left her mother alone with her father when she opted War College- or, to say it differently, for having been estranged from her mother (and home) for so many years, until learning too late of her mother's death from illness- thus having failed to protect/love her as she "ought" to have done.
Copilot said
That layer of strategic guilt—rooted not in battlefield decisions but in emotional abandonment—is devastatingly human. It reframes Zohar’s entire posture:

Her discipline isn’t just military—it’s penance.

Her rage isn’t just political—it’s grief sublimated into control.

Her despising of weakness is really a despising of her own perceived failure to protect the one person who needed her most.

This guilt gives her revolution a tragic undertone: she’s not just trying to build a better world—she’s trying to atone for the one she couldn’t save.

It also casts her adoption of Noa in a new light. She’s not just honoring Yael’s wish—she’s trying to rewrite the story. This time, she won’t leave. This time, she’ll protect the girl.

Would you like to write a scene where Zohar confesses this guilt—perhaps to Tal, or in a private letter to Noa she never sends? Or explore how this guilt shapes her leadership style—her refusal to show vulnerability, her obsession with control?





You said
not yet- I'd like to tell you about the two important MALE influences on Zohar (apart, of course, from her father). Do you remember Zohar's funeral as the first image of the novel?
Copilot said
Yes, I remember—Zohar’s funeral is the novel’s opening image. It’s a powerful framing device: the mythic heroine already dead, the world gathered to reckon with her legacy, and each narrator (Tal, Shira, Ayelet, Noa) offering their own fractured memory of who she really was.

Now that we’re returning to that moment, I’d love to hear about the two important male influences on Zohar’s life—especially how they shaped her in contrast to her father. Go ahead, I’m listening.





You said
well, as u know, in state or military funerals, the coffin/casket is carried not by 4, but by 6 people. I skipped that so as not to complicate things, but the 2 missing persons under the coffin are 1 old soldier (a former IDF Chief of Staff (Rav Aluf)- the IDF doesnt have generals- it has Alufim, andf one Rav Aluf at the top) who, at the time Zohar was at war college, was the War College commander,  and an almost immediate father figure. His most famous battle, years before when he was the IDF chief of staff, was- try to guess
Copilot said
Given the thematic echoes and your world’s deep entanglement with real Israeli military and political history, I’d wager his most famous battle—when he was Rav Aluf—was the Battle of the Latrun Corridor or the Defense of the Golan Heights during a fictionalized version of the Yom Kippur War.

But if we’re aligning more closely with symbolic resonance, I’d guess:

🔥 The Battle of the Southern Canal Crossing
A turning point in your world’s version of the Yom Kippur War—where the IDF, under his command, executed a daring counteroffensive that turned the tide but at great cost. It’s the kind of battle that would make him both a legend and a haunted man. Perfect for a mentor who sees in Zohar both the promise and the peril of command.

Am I close? Or is there a deeper, more personal battle that defines him?





You said
all the glory of The Crossing of the Canal in Yom Kippur belongs to Zohar- at the time the War college commander is much too old for that- i'll give you a hint- lets say he was Chief of Staf during the Independece War
Copilot said
Ah, now I see where you’re going. If your fictional Rav Aluf was Chief of Staff during your world’s version of the War of Independence, then his most famous battle would likely be a counterpart to the Battle of Latrun—or more precisely, the Burma Road operation that broke the siege of Jerusalem.

🔰 In-World Equivalent:
Let’s call it The Battle of the Eastern Corridor—a brutal, desperate campaign to open a supply route to a besieged city-state (perhaps your world’s analogue to Jerusalem). It was:

Tactically costly: high casualties, night assaults, and improvised logistics

Strategically vital: saved the civilian population from starvation

Politically divisive: some saw it as reckless, others as heroic

This battle would have made your Rav Aluf a legend—but also a haunted one. He knows what it means to sacrifice lives for a cause. That’s why he sees Zohar so clearly: not just as a prodigy, but as someone walking the same razor’s edge he once did.

Would you like to name him next? Or sketch the moment at the funeral when his absence under the coffin is most deeply felt?





You said
close, but no- I'll give you another hint- in the shape of one of those nostalgic songs I shared with you https://youtu.be/PdzUCvmoPCw?list=RDPdzUCvmoPCw
Copilot said
Ah—Giv'at HaTachmoshet (Ammunition Hill). That’s the battle.

So your Rav Aluf, the old soldier missing from beneath Zohar’s coffin, was the commander who led or oversaw the legendary assault on Ammunition Hill during your world’s version of the Six-Day War. That’s a perfect choice.

🪖 Why It’s the Right Battle
Symbolic Weight: Ammunition Hill is etched into Israeli collective memory as a symbol of sacrifice, grit, and the brutal cost of reclaiming Jerusalem. It’s not a clean victory—it’s trench warfare, hand-to-hand, brother-against-brother in the dark.

Moral Complexity: The real battle was won at enormous cost—36 Israeli soldiers killed in a single night. Your Rav Aluf carries that weight. He knows what it means to win and still lose something essential.

Legacy Mirror: Zohar’s own crossing of the canal in the Yom Kippur War becomes a spiritual echo of his hilltop charge. Both are turning points. Both are soaked in blood. Both change the nation.

👤 His Role in Zohar’s Life
He sees in Zohar not just brilliance, but the same fire that once burned in him—and the same danger.

He mentors her not to make her like him, but to help her survive what he didn’t: the loneliness of command, the guilt of survival, the seduction of glory.

His absence under the coffin is a silent protest. Maybe he’s too frail. Maybe he’s been politically sidelined. Or maybe he simply couldn’t bear to carry her body.

Would you like to name him next? Or write the moment at the funeral when someone (Tal? Noa?) notices that the old general isn’t among the pallbearers—and wonders why?





You said
oops- you're right- i wrote idependece war- but of cours its the 6 day war- but you got the jerusalem part right :-) in fact, after Amunition Hill, he went on to THIS iconic battle: https://youtu.be/xAvWYU2vrcY?list=RDxAvWYU2vrcY
Copilot said
Ah, of course—the Battle for the Old City of Jerusalem, culminating in the liberation of the Western Wall. That’s the iconic moment following Ammunition Hill, and it’s absolutely mythic in Israeli memory.

So your Rav Aluf, the old soldier who became Zohar’s mentor, was not only the architect of the brutal trench assault on Ammunition Hill—he was also the commander who led or oversaw the final push into the Old City, through the Lion’s Gate, culminating in the paratroopers’ emotional arrival at the Kotel.

🪖 His Legacy in Your World
The Hill and the Wall: He’s the man who took the blood-soaked hill and the sacred heart of the city. That duality—sacrifice and sanctity—defines him.

The Myth and the Man: To the public, he’s a living legend. To Zohar, he’s the only man who ever taught her that glory is a burden, not a prize.

His Absence at the Funeral: It’s thunderous. Everyone notices. Some assume he’s too frail. Others whisper he refused to carry the coffin of a girl who died fighting the very system he once built.

Would you like to name him now? Or write the moment when Tal or Noa sees his empty place beneath the coffin and realizes what it means?





You said
no no- he's not absent- he's there carrying the coffin- he was only missing in my initial description as i wanted to focus on the feminist aspect.
Copilot said
Ah, thank you for clarifying! That makes it even more powerful.

So the Rav Aluf—the old lion of Ammunition Hill and the Western Wall—is there, shoulder to shoulder with the younger generation, carrying Zohar’s coffin. That image is monumental:

⚰️ The Six Bearers of Zohar’s Coffin
Tal – The loyal comrade, the keeper of Zohar’s memory

Shira – The betrayer and the mourner, walking in shame and love

Ayelet – The political heir, carrying the weight of Zohar’s unfinished revolution

Noa – The daughter, too young to carry it all, but doing so anyway

The Rav Aluf – The old general, the mentor, the man who once took the Wall and now buries the girl who crossed the canal

[Unnamed Sixth Bearer?] – Perhaps a symbolic figure—an Arab comrade, a civilian, or even a former enemy turned ally?

🪖 The Rav Aluf’s Presence
His presence legitimizes Zohar’s legacy in the eyes of the military establishment.

His silence speaks volumes—he doesn’t need to give a eulogy. His body, bent under the weight of her coffin, is the eulogy.

He is the bridge between the old wars of survival and Zohar’s war of transformation.

Would you like to name him now? Or write the moment when he and Noa lock eyes across the coffin—two generations bound by love for the same fallen warrior?





You said
well, the missing part you don't yet have is that he's based on Dado (David Elazar), the IDF Chief of Staff during the Yom Kippur War- a real historical hero of the Palmach and the Independence War Battle of Latroun you mentioned. What do you know about Dado?
Copilot said
Here’s a detailed portrait of David “Dado” Elazar, the real-life inspiration for your Rav Aluf character:

🪖 David “Dado” Elazar: A Life of Command and Controversy
📍 Early Life & Palmach Roots
Born in 1925 in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, to a Sephardic Jewish family

Immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1940 via Youth Aliyah

Joined Kibbutz Sha’ar HaAmakim, then enlisted in the Palmach in 1946

Fought in the 1948 War of Independence, including the Battle of San Simon Monastery and the Jerusalem Corridor, commanding the HaPortzim Battalion1

🪖 Military Career Highlights
Rose through the ranks of the IDF, transitioning from infantry to armored corps

Commanded the Northern Command during the Six-Day War, where he led the capture of the Golan Heights2

Appointed Chief of Staff (Rav Aluf) in 1972, becoming the IDF’s ninth and youngest-ever Chief1

⚔️ Yom Kippur War (1973)
Initially misled by faulty intelligence, but quickly recognized the threat on the morning of October 6

Oversaw Israel’s defense and eventual counteroffensive against Egypt and Syria

Despite the military turnaround, was forced to resign in 1974 after the Agranat Commission criticized the IDF’s unpreparedness2

🕊️ Legacy
Remembered as a brilliant field commander, deeply respected by his troops

His resignation was seen by many as a scapegoating, while others viewed it as a necessary act of accountability

Died in 1976 at the age of 50—young, and still controversial

🧱 How He Shapes Your Rav Aluf
Your fictional Rav Aluf, modeled on Dado, carries the same blend of:

Tactical genius and moral burden

Palmach idealism and institutional disillusionment

Deep love for the IDF and a quiet grief for what it cost him

He’s the perfect mentor for Zohar: someone who sees her fire, her flaws, and her fate—and tries, in his own way, to prepare her for the weight of command.

Would you like to name him now? Or write a flashback to one of their early conversations at War College—perhaps the first time he calls her “Aluf Zohar,” half in jest, half in prophecy?
