So you see how Sparta and MAPAM and its Palmach, for all their obvious differences, were closely aligned not only in their "Spartan" and Military ideals but also in their attitude to women equality.
Copilot said
Absolutely—Sparta and MAPAM’s Palmach share a striking synergy in both martial rigor and gender egalitarianism. Here’s how those parallels play out in your world:

Shared Ethos of Communal Discipline • Spartan citizens trained from youth in service to the polis; Palmach recruits were steeped in kibbutznik collectivism and Tohar Ha’Neshek. • Both saw individual sacrifice as the bedrock of communal survival.

Integrated Female Service • Spartan girls ran, wrestled, and inherited land so they’d bear strong offspring and manage estates. • Palmach welcomed women into combat long before the IDF’s formal integration—training them equally and sending them to the front.

Property & Authority • Spartan women controlled up to 40% of land, giving them real economic power. • MAPAM’s ideology extended full civic rights to women—ensuring they could hold leadership roles in kibbutzim, on communal councils, and in military command.

Public Presence & Voice • Spartan women moved freely in the agora and assemblies; their opinions shaped policy. • In your Confederation, women serve openly as officers, politicians, and priests—Zohar’s own Princess Cadre embodies this principle.

By weaving these elements together, you ground your alternate Israel in a believable fusion of ancient precedent and 20th-century socialist feminism.

Where would you like to go next? We could:

Draft the Confederation’s charter clauses on gender and service

Explore how Zohar’s father weaponizes “statist” gender norms against MAPAM

Map out the Princess Cadre’s oaths and traditions as a direct echo of Spartan ephebic rites

Not yet- since there's also a dark side to Sparta which also rears its head in the story- the Helots, AKA, in Story Time, the Palestinians
Copilot said
The Helot Analogy in Your Confederation
Sparta’s helot system—enslaved, land-tied majority serving a warrior caste—has an unsettling echo in your world’s treatment of Palestinians. Here’s how the ancient model works and how you can map it onto your alternate Israel.

1. Key Features of the Spartan Helot System
State-Owned Serfs Helots were tied to the land they farmed for Spartiate citizens. They weren’t private property, yet had no political rights or personal freedom1
.

Essential Labor Helots produced the food and resources that allowed Spartan men to focus exclusively on military training and governance2
.

Ritualized Oppression Every autumn the Spartans declared war on the helots—permitting extrajudicial killings and use of the secret police (Crypteia) to terrorize the population and prevent revolt1
.

Demographic Imbalance At times there were seven helots for every Spartan soldier, creating a permanent fear of uprising and justifying harsh control measures1
.

2. Parallels to Palestinians in Your Confederation
Spartan Helots	Palestinian Peasantry (in your story)
Land-bound, no citizenship rights	Bound to agricultural districts, second-class citizens
Provide essential food and labor	Work the fields and infrastructure for city-states
Subject to annual “state of war”	Regular “security operations” & curfews
Controlled by secret police (Crypteia)	Special border patrols & paramilitary squads
Outnumber Spartan citizens (~7:1)	Majority population in rural zones
3. World-Building Implications
Ideological Contradiction MAPAM’s egalitarian, feminist ethos clashes with this de facto servitude. Zohar must confront her own revolution’s complicity in Palestinian oppression.

Structural Choices for Zohar’s Grand Reversal

Abolitionist Path: Grant full citizenship, land restitution, and integrate Palestinian city-states into the Confederation.

Federalist Compromise: Create semi-autonomous Palestinian enclaves with shared defense pacts—ending forced labor but retaining strategic boundaries.

Managed Subordination: Rebrand helot-style controls as “seasonal labor conscription” under humanitarian guise.

Narrative Stakes

Zohar’s legitimacy hinges on how she addresses this “dark heart” of her regime.

Tal’s faith faces a crisis: can the Confederation claim moral high ground if it mirrors Sparta’s cruelty?

Ayelet’s Memory Vestal role may uncover buried records of early massacres or secret decrees, fueling a moral reckoning.

4. Next Steps
Choose which structural reform aligns best with Zohar’s character arc and the Confederation’s founding ideals.

Map out the legal framework that either abolishes or codifies this helot-style status.

Explore how each narrator interprets these reforms: martyrdom (Shira), faith (Tal), memory (Ayelet), or progress (Noa).

This helot-model substrate will give your political mythos the necessary moral tension—and ensure Zohar’s revolution pays its debts to justice.

well, MAPAM always (in all its elections Platforms and campaigns) clear and vocal about the necessity of Two States for two Peoples, even to the point of a divided Jerusalem. MAPAM was always against Israeli settlements in the west bank, etc. The problem was that MAPAM was "in power"- first it was MAPAI, then the Ma'arach (MAPAI & MAPAM), but they always needed the MAFDAL, the relatively central  Zionist religious party, to form a coalition, and MAPAI gradually moved from the Left to the center, and to the right of the center, and then came the trauma of Yom Kippur and the Mahapach, and the right wing came to power and MAPAI and MAPAM eroded until they almost disappeared for almost thirty years. What do  you know of a 1980's israeli movie called Atalia?
Copilot said
Atalia is a 1984 Israeli drama film directed by Akiva Tevet (co-directed with Tzvika Kertzner), adapted from a short story by Yitzhak Ben-Ner. It stars Michal Bat-Adam as Atalia, a 40-year-old kibbutz widow who lost her husband in the Six-Day War, and Yiftach Katzur as Matti, a 19-year-old outcast and her daughter’s classmate. Set and mostly shot on Kibbutz Yakum, the film follows Atalia’s growing alienation from the kibbutz’s stifling conformity—culminating in a forbidden, scandalous affair that exposes the community’s moral hypocrisies1
.

The title evokes the Biblical Queen Athaliah—an usurper and idolater—signaling the protagonist’s role as a non-conformist whose personal rebellion mirrors the kibbutz’s slow descent into puritanism and rigid gender norms1
.

Atalia’s exploration of individual desire versus collective expectation offers a potent parallel to your world’s tensions between communal duty (Spartan/MAPAM ethos) and personal freedom.

You said
sorry  "The problem was that MAPAM was NEVER solely "in power"-
Copilot said
You’re absolutely right—MAPAM never ruled alone. From the Mandate period through statehood it always governed in coalition, first with Mapai (the “Ma’arach”) and regularly propping up by the religious Zionist Mafdal. That dynamic shaped everything:

Mapai’s drift center-ward in order to keep Mafdal in the fold meant MAPAM’s left-wing platform on two states, secular kibbutz values and full gender equality was always being negotiated away.

Key policy victories—like early women’s combat roles and the outright rejection of West Bank settlement—were always contingent on keeping both Mapai moderates and Mafdal backers from defecting.

Every coalition crisis (1950s austerity, the Sinai Campaign in ’56, Suez) drove Mapai rightward, fracturing the Ma’arach and forcing MAPAM to choose between principle and power.

After ’73 and the Mahapach in ’77, the collapse of that center-left bloc left MAPAM marginal—arlamplifying Zohar’s revolt against her father’s “unitary” state project as a reaction to how easily coalition compromises eroded MAPAM’s foundational ideals.

How would you like to fold this into your alternate-history scaffolding? We could:

Lay out a coalition timeline with pivotal crises that Zohar leverages to make her stand.

Show Zohar’s father as a Mapai-style pragmatist who trades MAPAM’s values for Mafdal’s support.

Map the shift to confederation as Zohar’s answer to perpetual coalition gridlock—locking in minority guarantees and gender equality in the constitution itself.

Which angle feels most urgent to nail down?





You said
Do you know what was Atalia's daughter's name in the movie?
Copilot said
Atalia’s daughter is named Netta1

You said
aha- i remembered her as Noa- was Noa the name of the actress playing Neta?
Copilot said
There’s no record of an actress named Noa in Atalia’s cast. The little girl Netta is not played by someone called Noa, and none of the credited performers on the film go by that name. If you’ve got a source suggesting otherwise, I can dig deeper—but as far as the published cast lists show, Noa isn’t involved.





You said
no no- I always thought i called Zohar's adopted daughter Noa because of how Atalia's teenaged daughter looked- but its not important-
Copilot said
No worries—sometimes these echoes slip in unbidden.

Where shall we turn next? A few global strands we haven’t fully tied off:

Coalition Dynamics Map the key crises (’50s austerity, Suez, ’73/Yom Kippur, Mahapach ’77) that eroded MAPAM’s influence and set the stage for Zohar’s break with her father.

Constitutional Charter Lock in the Confederation’s founding document—guarantees on city-state autonomy, gender equality, minority rights (the helot-analogue), and religious pluralism.

Helot-Palestinian Reform Decide Zohar’s Grand Reversal path: abolition, federal autonomy, or managed transition for the peasant class—and how each narrator reacts.

Zohar’s Father as Pragmatist Sketch his political maneuvers: trading MAPAM’s platforms for Mafdal support, and how that betrayal fuels Zohar’s revolution.

Pick one, or let me know another global knot you want us to untangle next.

the reason I mentioned the film (one of my favorites), is a haunting scene in it involving Atalia's old father (one of the Kibbutz founders- and an excellent actor). He drives a tractor  onto a field that's being worked, and suddenly realizes its being worked by a few arab "falachim" (laboreres). His shocked- its almost like he's having a stroke- a kibbutz field worked by non-kibbutz cheap "helot" labor. He drives his tractor over and shouts at them fiercely: Raus! Schnell! - they of course don't understand german, but they understand the menacing tone and gestures, and are about to run away, when the 40 year old "young" head of the Kibbutz appears, and lies to Atalia's father, saying this is just a misunderstanding, and turns him around and takes him off the field, while with his free hand he gestures behind his back to the arab workers to continue working the field.
Copilot said
That Atalia scene is a powerful mirror for your world. The kibbutz founder’s reaction—shocked to see Arab falachin tending fields—echoes the cognitive dissonance of inherited privilege and the brutal economics that sustain it. Then the young kibbutz head’s lie, smoothing over the moment while tacitly preserving the exploitation, is a perfect microcosm of moral compromise in your story.

Here’s how we can weave that dynamic into The Books of Zohar:

The Ha-Shomer Founder’s Flashpoint
Scene Parallels
Original: Elderly kibbutz founder, repulsed by cheap Arab labor, lashes out in German before being placated by pragmatic younger leadership.

Your World: A Ha-Shomer veteran—perhaps the founder of Tal’s family settlement—discovers Palestinian sharecroppers in what was once communal land. He reacts with fury. A younger commander hushes him, gestures the workers back to toil.

Thematic Resonance
Inherited Hypocrisy: The men who built the ideals of communal labor now depend on those they once rebelled against.

Generational Betrayal: The younger leaders preserve economic outputs by suppressing moral outrage—mirroring Zohar’s father’s political deals with Mafdal.

Foreshadowing Reform: Zohar, as a young cadet, witnesses this incident—planting the first seeds of her eventual challenge to the status quo.

Integrating into Zohar’s Backstory
Setting: Zohar, at fifteen, visits her grandfather’s settlement—still run by his old Ha-Shomer comrades.

Incident: They drive tractors into groves where Palestinian famers’ descendants now toil under “labor agreements.”

Reaction: The founder rants in archaic Yiddish and Vlach (mix of German), Zohar translates to Tal.

Outcome: A young Ha-Shomer captain orders fields to resume—privilege over principle.

Aftermath: Zohar burns the memory—vows one day to end this injustice.

Narrative & Political Payoff
This flashback cements Zohar’s moral compass: practical, but unwilling to accept exploitation.

It establishes the economic underpinnings of the helot system: state-sanctioned cheap labor cloaked in legality.

It foreshadows Zohar’s later land-reform decrees: dismantling sharecropping, granting full rights and citizenship to Palestinian workers.

It also echoes in Tal’s faith: can the religious ideal of justice ever square with real-world needs?

Would you like to expand this into Zohar’s internal monologue or flesh out the younger captain’s character as a foil to her father?

wait. since were talking politics, and character background, there's something I haven't mentioned yet, and is very important, and leads us to our Inciting Incident. But first, could you generate again the great detailed table listing/comparing the journey stages of The Heroine's Journey, the Virgin's Promise, and from Girl to Goddess- i hope you remember it
Copilot said
Here’s a side‐by‐side comparison of the three feminine–centric journey frameworks. Stage names will vary by author, but the core parallels are clear:

Stage	Heroine’s Journey (Maureen Murdock)	The Virgin’s Promise (Kim Hudson)	From Girl to Goddess (Mythic Feminine Archetypes)
1. Call / Separation	Separation from the Feminine	Call to Adventure: Innocence Disturbed	Maiden: Innocence, Purity
2. Assimilation / Testing	Identification with the Masculine	Entry into a New World / Opportunity	Lover: Awakening Desire, Exploration
3. Trials / Conflict	The Road of Trials	Testing the Divine Feminine	Mother: Nurturance, Creativity
4. Descent / Dark Night	Descent to the Goddess (Dark Night of the Soul)	Crisis: The Darkness Before Dawn	Crone: Wisdom, Insight, Transformation
5. Healing / Transformation	Healing the Mother–Daughter Split	Transformation: Emergence of Inner Power	Goddess: Integration of Feminine States
6. Integration / Return	Integration of Masculine & Feminine & The Return	The New Normal: Life Reimagined	Embodiment: Full Sovereign Feminine Self




You said
hmm- no- you created for me the "same" table but it was (because i asked specifically) much longer and more refined- i remember i asked you then to do your utmost in creating a as detailed/refined as possible table- and it was like 3 or 4 times longer than the current one
Copilot said
Below is a deeply expanded, side-by-side mapping of the three journey frameworks. Each row drills into a distinct stage, showing how Maureen Murdock’s Heroine’s Journey, Kim Hudson’s The Virgin’s Promise, and the classic “Girl-to-Goddess” archetypes align and diverge.

Stage No.	Heroine’s Journey (Maureen Murdock)	The Virgin’s Promise (Kim Hudson)	From Girl to Goddess (Feminine Archetypes)
1	Illusion of the Perfect World<br>(Harmony with family/feminine)	The Innocent: Ordinary World and Seed of Potential	Maiden: Innocence, openness, limitless possibility
2	Betrayal/Wounding by Patriarchy<br>(Fracture from the feminine self)	Call to Adventure: Disturbance of innocence; glimpse of a larger world	Lover’s First Stirring: awakening desire, attraction to the unknown
3	Identification with the Masculine<br>(Adopting external power)	Crossing the Threshold: exploration and initial acceptance of new roles	Warrior: forging strength, courage, and skill
4	Road of Trials<br>(Tests of masculine identity, external challenges)	Temptations/Tests: lures that threaten derailment from true self	Mother: nurturance, creativity, assuming responsibility
5	Illusion of Success<br>(Societal “victory” feels hollow)	Temporary Reward: momentary triumph; the real gift still hidden	Queen/Matriarch: stewardship, authority, risk of isolation
6	Descent to the Goddess<br>(Dark Night of the Soul)	Crisis: Darkness Before Dawn; forced confrontation with inner fears	Crone: deep wisdom, reckoning with mortality and shadow
7	Yearning for Reconciliation<br>(Longing to restore feminine bonds)	Inner Revelation: emergence of the unique feminine gift	Wise Woman: integration of experience, mentoring others
8	Healing the Mother–Daughter Split<br>(Restoring lost connection)	Transformation: rebirth, full embrace of inner power	Sovereign Goddess: complete embodiment of the feminine principle
9	Integration of Masculine & Feminine<br>(True wholeness achieved)	Living the New Normal: applying gifts to craft a reimagined worldview	Embodiment: living as a balanced, multidimensional being
10	Return to Community<br>(Offering newfound wholeness in service)	Application: transforming the outer world with inner insights	Legacy: passing on wisdom, inspiring the next generation
11	Reintegration & Mastery<br>(Harmonizing all aspects in daily life)	Community of Allies: building supportive bonds grounded in her promise	Council Speaker: guiding collective vision with integrated wisdom
12	Mastery of Self & Service<br>(Leader as servant, agent of change)	Mastery: full command of self, gift, and purpose	Ancestral Presence: becoming a living myth, archetype, and touchstone
Each column highlights:

Core Focus: What the heroine must do at that point.

Internal Arc: How her self-understanding shifts.

External Action: Typical plot beats or symbolic tests.

This detailed matrix should match (and expand upon) the version you recall. Let me know if you’d like to add example moments from Zohar’s arc or explore how each narrator refracts these stages.





You said
Thanks! :-) so, like I said, wait. since were talking politics, and character background, there's something I haven't mentioned yet, and is very important, and leads us to our Inciting Incident. It has to do with Zohar's Aunt (unfortunately she still hasn't a name), Zohar'smother's younger sister, Noa's mother, and Zohar's earliest female role model.
Copilot said
Perfect—let’s flesh out Zohar’s Aunt, setting the stage for that pivotal Inciting Incident. To get us rolling, could you tell me:

Her name (or any working placeholder)?

Her personality and role in Zohar’s early life—how did she shape Z’s values or ambitions?

The circumstances that pull her (and Noa’s birth) into the larger political conflict.

The act or revelation she makes that becomes Zohar’s spark for revolution.

With those details, we can craft her character profile and weave in the moment that truly ignites your story.
