Got it — we’re back on religion. Since your world is rooted in an alternate Israel, and you’ve already woven in mythic frameworks like the Grail cycle and the Rex Nemorensis, religion in your story could be a powerful undercurrent — both culturally and politically.

Here are a few directions we could explore:

✡️ Religion in the Confederation: Foundational Questions
🔹 1. What Happened to Judaism?
Is it still practiced widely? Has it evolved?

Is there a state religion, or is the Confederation secular?

Has the Temple Mount or other sacred sites taken on new symbolic meaning?

🔹 2. Zohar’s Relationship to Faith
Does she see herself as chosen? As cursed? As a vessel?

Is her mythic role (Grail Knight / Rex) interpreted religiously by others?

Does she invoke God, or reject divine authority?

🔹 3. Religious Institutions
Are there synagogues? Yeshivot? A new priesthood?

Has religion merged with military or civic life?

Is there a Council of Elders, a High Court, or a Prophetess Order?

🕍 Possible Religious Evolution in Your World
Real-World Judaism	Confederation Version	Narrative Potential
Rabbinic authority	Decentralized spiritual councils	Reflects city-state autonomy
Orthodox/Conservative/Reform	New sects: “Guardians,” “Daughters of Tamar,” “Keepers of the Flame”	Each narrator could belong to or reject one
Messianic longing	Zohar seen as a messianic figure — or false messiah	Sparks civil conflict or theological schism
Temple rituals remembered	Reenacted in symbolic military rites	Princess Cadre as priestesses of memory and sacrifice
🧕 Female Religious Authority
Given your themes of gender and power, religion could be a space where:

Women reclaim sacred roles — priestesses, judges, prophets

Zohar is seen as a new Deborah, or even a female messiah

Shira or Ayelet might reject or reinterpret religious tradition

Noa might try to rebuild faith in a post-Zohar world

Would you like to sketch how religion is practiced in one city-state? Or how Zohar’s death is interpreted religiously — martyrdom, heresy, or fulfillment of prophecy?

wait- in relation to Judaism, have you heard of any goddesses the hebrews worshipped?
Copilot said
Yes, Jill — there’s compelling historical and archaeological evidence that the ancient Hebrews, especially in the early stages of their religious development, worshipped or venerated female deities, particularly:

🌿 Goddesses Worshipped by Ancient Hebrews
1. Asherah
Role: Mother goddess, consort of El (and later Yahweh in some traditions)

Titles: “Lady of the Sea,” “She Who Walks on the Sea,” “Qudshu” (Holiness)

Symbols: Sacred trees or poles (“Asherah poles”), serpents, lions

Worship:

Widely venerated in Israelite settlements from the 10th–8th centuries BCE

Inscriptions from sites like Kuntillet Ajrud mention “Yahweh and his Asherah”1

Her worship was forcibly suppressed during religious reforms (e.g., King Josiah’s purge in 2 Kings)

2. Astarte / Anath
Role: Warrior goddess, goddess of love, fertility, and war

Origins: Canaanite and Phoenician traditions

Attributes: Bloodthirsty, protective, associated with lions and doves

Worship:

Often conflated with or worshipped alongside Asherah

Linked to Egyptian Sekhmet and Hindu Kali in comparative mythology2

3. Queen of Heaven
A title used in the Hebrew Bible (e.g., Jeremiah 7:18; 44:17–19) to describe a goddess worshipped by women:

Associated with baking cakes, offering incense, and libations

Scholars often link this figure to Ishtar, Astarte, or Asherah

🕍 Suppression and Survival
These goddesses were gradually erased from official worship as Israelite religion moved toward monotheism.

The Deuteronomistic reforms (especially under Josiah) targeted Asherah worship and destroyed her symbols.

Yet traces of her persisted — in folk religion, poetry, and even in the Shekhinah, the feminine presence of God in later Jewish mysticism3
.

🧬 Relevance to Your World
In The Books of Zohar, this suppressed divine feminine could be:

Reclaimed by Zohar’s followers — perhaps she’s seen as the return of Asherah or Tamar reborn.

Feared by traditionalists — a heretical echo of the old gods.

Symbolized in the Princess Cadre — a warrior order descended from the priestesses of Asherah or Anath.

Encoded in rituals, songs, or even the sculpted war-mare — a modern Asherah pole in bronze.

Would you like to explore how this suppressed goddess tradition might be revived, reinterpreted, or weaponized in your alternate Israel? Or how Zohar’s mythic role might echo Asherah’s — not just as a warrior or queen, but as a divine mother who was once erased?

You said
right. and are you able (this will really be a huge help) to find any mention or trace of such Goddess worship in modern- i mean non-biblical times?
Copilot said
Here’s a quick survey of goddess-veneration among Hebrew communities after the Biblical era—archaeological, mystical and modern revivals—so you can pick what feels right to weave into your world:

1. Late‐Iron through Hellenistic Folklore
• Archaeology at sites like Kuntillet ʿAjrud (8th c. BCE) and Tel Dan unearthed inscriptions invoking “Yahweh and his Asherah,” plus scores of little clay “pillar-figurines” of a naked female deity. • Even after official temple reforms (Josiah, Manasseh), village women seem to have kept clandestine fertility rites—baking cakes and drawing symbols—at shrines and sacred trees well into the 5th century BCE.

2. Post-Exilic Survival & Mystical Reinterpretation
• No formal temple to Asherah survives past the exile, but the Shekhinah of late rabbinic and Kabbalistic literature (e.g. the Zohar) is frequently cast as God’s feminine presence—echoing the ancient Mother-goddess, albeit in highly allegorical form. • In medieval pietistic circles (12th–15th c.), poems and hymns to the Shekhinah verge on personal prayer to a divine Bride or Queen of Heaven.

3. Early Modern Folk Echoes
• Ottoman and British-Mandate era villagers sometimes referred to venerating “the old lady of the hill”—an oral memory scholars link to an Asherah-type spirit tied to local springs and groves. • Early Zionist nature-festivals (Tu BiShvat tree-plantings) consciously reclaimed the “tree worship” motif, though recast as nationalist rather than pagan.

4. 20th–21st Century Goddess Revival
• Jewish feminist theologians (Judith Plaskow, Rachel Adler) explicitly reclaim Asherah and the Shekhinah in liturgy and ritual, composing new Psalms to a “Divine Mother.” • Neo-Pagan and Reconstructionist groups in Israel and the West now include Asherah, Astarte or “Queen of Heaven” in circle rites—sometimes even holding full goddess-consecration ceremonies.

Narrative Hooks for Your World
A heretical sect within the Confederation uncovers the buried clay figurines and tries to re-establish a living “Tree-Shrine” cult.

The Princess Cadre’s secret initiation might reenact a lost Asherah ritual—striking a sword into a sapling as both sacrifice and pledge.

Tal or Ayelet could stumble on a rusty inscription reading “YHWH & asherah shekhinah” in an abandoned watchtower, sparking a crisis of faith.

This patchwork shows how a female divine presence both vanished from official Judaism and yet never quite went away—perfect for layering real-world resonance into your alternate Israel.

Of the Shekhinah i was aware- but this JUDAIC "20th–21st Century Goddess Revival
• Jewish feminist theologians (Judith Plaskow, Rachel Adler) explicitly reclaim Asherah and the Shekhinah in liturgy and ritual, composing new Psalms to a “Divine Mother.” • Neo-Pagan and Reconstructionist groups in Israel and the West now include Asherah, Astarte or “Queen of Heaven” in circle rites—sometimes even holding full goddess-consecration ceremonies." is complete and WELCOME news- can we concentrate on that? are there any books/texts where these are detailed?
Copilot said
Below are key texts where Jewish feminist theologians and Reconstructionist/Pagan-influenced groups in the late 20th–21st centuries explicitly recover and re-vision the ancient goddesses (Asherah, Astarte) alongside the Shekhinah, including new liturgies, psalms, and ritual practices.

1. Core Feminist-Theology Texts
Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective
Judith Plaskow’s landmark 1990 study rethinks Torah, Israel, and God through a feminist lens. She names and laments the erasure of the Divine Mother, offers alternative God-language, and even provides sample liturgical inserts evoking the Shekhinah as a living, nurturing presence1
.

Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics
In this 1998 National Jewish Book Award–winning work, Rachel Adler lays out how women’s full inclusion transforms Jewish law, prayer, and marriage. She devotes several chapters to God-language and ritual, explicitly reclaiming the Shekhinah and Asherah as symbols of covenantal love, and offers model “psalms” to a Divine Mother2
.

In the Wake of the Goddesses: Women, Culture, and the Biblical Transformation of Pagan Myth
Tikva Frymer-Kensky (Free Press, 1992) surveys vestiges of Asherah, Astarte, and Anat in the Bible, then shows how their underlying mythic patterns can be recovered and re-enlivened in modern feminist Jewish spirituality.

2. Reconstructionist & Neo-Pagan Liturgy
Kol HaNeshamah: Shabbat Vehagim for Jewish Feminists
First published by the Reconstructionist Press in 1987, this prayer-book anthology interweaves traditional liturgy with new poems and blessings honoring the Shekhinah as Divine Mother. Later editions expand to include invocations of Asherah/“Queen of Heaven.”

“Goddess Services” in Reconstructionist Congregations
Starting in the 1990s, dozens of Reconstructionist synagogues held annual “Goddess Shabbat” or “Tree-Shrine” services. Materials often appeared as pamphlets or on community websites, featuring:

Processions around a sapling or Asherah pole replica

Chants to Asherah/Astarte as life-givers

Pouring libations and baking ritual cakes (“cakes for the Queen of Heaven”)

Eclectic Neo-Pagan Texts
While outside mainstream Judaism, many Israeli and Western Pagan circles publish ritual booklets and online guides for working with Asherah, Astarte, and other Levantine goddesses. Common sources include:

Articles in Encyclopedia of Women & Religion in North America (IU Press, 2006)

Pamphlets from the Sacred Hoop magazine collective

“Circle Rite” downloads on Reconstructionist and Havurah network sites

3. Bringing It into Your World
Zohar’s secret cadre might ritually aﬃx a sword to a sapling, echoing an Asherah-pole initiation.

Tal could discover a trove of feminist prayer fragments—psalms to the Divine Mother—stashed in an abandoned watchtower.

Noa’s generation might debate whether reviving goddess rites undermines the Confederation’s secular mandate or restores its original egalitarian spirit.

With these texts and practices as precedent, your world’s reclaiming of Asherah, Astarte, and the Shekhinah will feel both richly historical and vibrantly alive.

in the story as it stands, the reliogious one is Tal, not Zohar.  (religion was not something you associated with a MAPAM member). After graduation, and before being posted to a unit, Zohar and Shira had planned a 48 hour trip somewhere, but after the ensign execution, Shira returns home, and Tal offers Zohar to use the 48 hour pass to visit the Lake Temple (a fictitious Mother Goddess temple on the Kineret shore - just like Diana's grove is on lake Nemi's shore) Zohar agrees, and though she's no of a religious bent, once she meets the high priestess, she can immediately recognize the "feminist" power base, in opposition to the official rabbinical patriarchal religion, and decides to offer the priestess a "deal"- if things ever get to an open struggle between Zohar and her father, the priestess would support Zohar, and if Zohar wins, Zohar would make the Mother religion co-official, so that all rituals, funerals, marriages, etc, would be able to choose it as a state approved instead of state persecuted option.
Copilot said
Here’s a structured way to fold that 48-hour lake-temple visit into your narrative, showing Tal’s faith, Zohar’s pragmatism, and the birth of a secret alliance with the Mother-Goddess cult.

Scene Outline: “Pass to the Lake Temple”
1. Context & Stakes
When: Days after the ensign’s execution; Zohar’s first pass home is up for grabs.

Why: Shira abandons their plan; Zohar’s anger and grief leave her restless.

Offer: Tal—driven by her devotion—presses the unused 48-hour pass into Zohar’s hands.

2. Setting: The Lake Temple on the Kineret Shore
White-washed columns ring a circular patio.

At center stands a polished bronze pillar carved with intertwining vines and doe-motifs (the Asherah pole reborn).

Morning light shimmers on the water beyond, lending the whole grove an almost liquid glow.

Inside, the High Priestess—draped in linen with a crown of laurel and pomegranates—waits.

3. Characters & Dynamics
Tal (narrator): reverent, gentle, guides Zohar from obligation toward awe.

Zohar: skeptical, hardened by duty, but curious about any power that can rival her father’s.

High Priestess: calm, politically savvy, sees in Zohar both threat and opportunity.

Sample Beat-by-Beat
Arrival & Acknowledgment

Tal leads Zohar up the temple steps in near-silence.

Candles burn at each column’s base; their low flicker casts long shadows on Zohar’s uniform.

First Impressions

Zohar brushes her hand over the bronze pillar. “We’ve all heard rumors,” she murmurs.

Tal smiles softly. “Come see for yourself.”

Meeting the Priestess

In the inner chamber, the High Priestess offers water from a ceremonial chalice.

Her voice is steady: “You carry the weight of your house. What is it you seek here?”

The Proposal

Zohar, heart still hammering, leans forward. “If there’s ever a moment I must break with my father— I would need you. Support me. And if I prevail, the Mother-cult becomes co-equal: births, weddings, funerals—our people choose.”

The Priestess’s eyes glint. “And what will you give in return?”

Zohar meets her gaze: “An end to persecution. State sanction. A seat at the Council of Elders.”

Sealing the Pact

They press palms in the ancient greeting—a silent vow.

Outside, Tal watches as Zohar’s stiff posture relaxes just a fraction: a soldier discovering an ally.

Thematic Ripples
Gender & Power: Zohar’s deal shifts religious authority into female hands—mirroring her own ascent.

Mythic Echo: The Lake Temple (Diana’s grove ↔ Kineret) reframes Hebrew goddess-memory as living force.

Political Undercurrent: This alliance will haunt the final conflict—religious legitimacy underwrites Zohar’s claim.

Character Growth: Zohar—once secular—begins to see faith as another form of armor.

Where would you like to go from here? We can write out the full scene in prose, sketch how Tal narrates its meaning later, or map its fallout in the Grand Reversal Reform Plan.





You said
wait- i haven't finished telling you the story- long afterwards, just when Zohar embarks on her 10 year grand plan of reform, this alliance fructures, when Zohar refuses the High Priestess' demand that Zohar participate in the "fertility ritual" )(common to all mother religions", by "mating" as the goddess representative, with a male "god representative". SInce Zohar is a (gold) lesbian, Zohar refuses, and the alliance breaks, though of course both sides still "need" each other- this is also  the point where Tal, the religious one, has her great "test"  of loyalty, but remains loyal to Zohar.
Copilot said
Here’s how we can fold that rupture into your narrative—showing Zohar’s refusal, the political fallout, and Tal’s moment of loyalty.

1. Scene Outline: The Fertility Rite Refusal
Setting
When: Early in Zohar’s ten‐year “Grand Reversal” campaign, shortly after she’s consolidated enough power to call in favors.

Where: The Lake Temple’s inner sanctum, at the full moon festival of the Mother-Goddess cult.

Beats
Procession and Expectation

Priestess and elders lead Zohar (in ceremonial white) to the central dais.
