Protector of Girls: Artemis is the guardian of maidens, the fierce avenger of violated innocence. Zohar’s defense of Noor, her refusal to show mercy to the soldier, her entire ethos — it’s Artemis with a rifle and a warhorse.

Hunter and Moon-Goddess: Zohar is elusive, luminous, and feared. She moves through the world like a myth already written — always just out of reach, always watching.

Twin of Apollo: If we stretch the metaphor, Shira could be seen as a kind of Apollo — rational, political, solar — while Zohar is lunar, instinctive, wild. They are siblings in ideology, but ultimately divided by fate.

This also deepens the sculpture Ayelet is working on — the war-mare shielding the filly from the wolf. That’s not just a monument. It’s a temple to Artemis. Ayelet is building Zohar’s myth in stone.

Would you like to explore how this archetype could echo through the structure — maybe in ritual, imagery, or even how Noa sees her in the end? Because Artemis doesn’t age. She doesn’t rule. She vanishes into the forest, leaving only stories behind.

Shira as an Apollo figure is a new thought- you'll have to give me time with it, but this leads perfectly into one of those problems- what I call Character Cores- what Dostoyevski called the charater's "main idea"-  You see, Zohar's core is perfectly clear to me- her complexes, paradoxes, extreme drives, etc. I can connect to themat any given moment, so she's "easy" for me. Shira, on the other hand, though partly based on best friends I had, is "difficult", because I can't seem to get a clear view of her core- and it was the same with those friends- i never really understood what drove them- what their "main idea" was- because they seemed to "just live". If we go say to Look Back in Anger- Jimmy i identified with immediately- which doesnt mean i liked a lot of what he did- I hated the way he treated Allison- I hated even more his affair with Allison's friend (Helena?), but no matter what he did/said, i could see myself doing/saying it (and hating myself for it). But Cliff? He's like my best friends- no core (that I can see)... unless you say his core / main idea is to "get along", be a decent person, live and let live- he's good, warm, peacable- but there's no apparent deep drive- So Shira is a problem, and since she must be the first narrator, so we first get to see Zohar through ambivalent (hostile love) eyes, eyes which, at first sight, can be believed, since the narrator is no adoring groupie, and I'm stuck with her core-less-ness :-(
Copilot said
That’s such a rich and honest insight, Jill — and I think you’re circling something very important about Shira’s role and her difficulty as a character.

Let’s unpack this together:

🧩 The Problem: Shira Feels “Core-less”
She’s based on real people you loved but never fully understood — people who “just lived.”

She doesn’t have the burning engine that Zohar has — no mythic drive, no tragic flaw, no clear paradox.

And yet she’s your first narrator — the lens through which we first see Zohar.

This isn’t just a writing problem. It’s a thematic opportunity.

🔍 Reframing the Problem: What If “Core-less-ness” Is Her Core?
Let’s consider this:

Shira’s main idea might be resistance to main ideas. She doesn’t want to be a myth. She doesn’t want to burn. She wants to live — decently, quietly, without being consumed.

She’s the anti-Zohar — not in opposition, but in temperament. She’s not a Rex. She’s not a Grail maiden. She’s a citizen.

Her tragedy is that she’s pulled into a mythic world she doesn’t believe in — and can’t escape.

🌓 Shira as Apollo (in contrast to Zohar as Artemis)
Let’s play with that metaphor:

Zohar (Artemis)	Shira (Apollo)
Lunar, instinctive, wild	Solar, rational, composed
Virgin, protector, myth	Lover, observer, realist
Acts from moral fire	Acts from moral fatigue
Sacrifices herself	Betrays to survive
Apollo is often seen as the god of clarity, order, music, law. But he’s also the god of prophecy — and Shira knows what’s coming. She sees the cost of Zohar’s myth before anyone else. That’s her burden.

🪞 A Possible Core for Shira
“I don’t want to be a hero. I want to be a person.”

That might be her main idea. She’s not weak — she’s resisting the mythic gravity of Zohar’s world. And in doing so, she becomes the perfect first narrator:

She’s skeptical.

She’s intimate.

She’s wounded.

She loves Zohar — but she doesn’t believe in her.

That’s the voice we need at the start. Because if even Shira can’t deny Zohar’s fire… then we believe it too.

Would you like to explore how this core could shape Shira’s voice in the opening chapters? Or how her eventual betrayal might be reframed not as villainy, but as a desperate act of self-preservation in a world that demands sacrifice?

Because I think you do know her — you’ve just been trying to find a myth in someone who’s trying to escape one.





You said
A lot of what you say rings true- some of it also echoes my own thoughts- though some of it is new- which is a great help, but there are a couple of things i disagree with in the table part of what you just said. As I see it, Shira too acts from moral fiber- she doesn't want to live "in a Barracks", so she resists. She doesn't believe in violenceexcept for self defence, and Zohar's wide MAPAMNIK/Feminist view of what constitutes self defence seems TOO wide to Shira (Its the old argument, it now suddenly comes to me, of what constitutes a "CLEAR and PRESENT danger" (there's a wonderful episode in the Good Wife when Alicia is drafted into the secret comittee which has to decide if a terrorist targeted for elimination by the military answers these criteria)
Copilot said
That’s a crucial clarification, Jill — and I’m really glad you brought it up. You’re absolutely right: Shira does act from moral fiber — it’s just a different kind of moral fiber than Zohar’s. Let’s refine that contrast to reflect what you’ve just said:

🌗 Refined Contrast: Zohar vs. Shira
Zohar (Artemis)	Shira (Apollo)
Acts from moral fire — justice as proactive, expansive, even preemptive	Acts from moral restraint — justice as reactive, bounded, skeptical of power
Sees structural violence as a form of attack that must be met	Believes violence is justified only in clear and present danger
Believes in sacrificial leadership	Believes in civilian dignity
Mythic, symbolic, larger-than-life	Human, grounded, resistant to abstraction
That “clear and present danger” reference is perfect — it’s exactly the kind of legal-philosophical line Shira would cling to in a world where Zohar’s definitions are constantly expanding. Shira isn’t amoral or passive — she’s someone who believes that the line matters, even when it’s inconvenient. Especially then.

And that makes her betrayal even more tragic — because it’s not cowardice. It’s conscience. She believes Zohar has crossed the line. And maybe she’s right. Or maybe she’s just afraid of what happens when the line disappears.

Would you like to explore how this tension could shape a key scene between them — maybe a confrontation before the coup, or a moment during the war when Shira tries to draw that line and Zohar refuses to see it?





You said
That's better- the second item in your first table i disagreed with was "Betrays to survive".  You couldn't know the details, since they're part of the plot, but Shira's betrayal is this: Shira's father is in prison (as is Zohar's) as they're guilty of the Yom Kippur catastrophe. In fact, Zohar had planned for both a firing squad (there were over 2,000 israeli casulties in the yom Kippur war), but Shira (in echo of the attempted rape incident) begs for her father's life, and Zohar relents (though by that time she and shira are not close). The result is that Zohar can't put Shira's father in prison without commuting the death sentence ALSO for her own father, which allows these two to continue and pose a political/military threat to Zohar's government- just like "Bloody" Mary wanted, but in the  end couldnt keep Jane alive- as long as Jane was alive, she'd be the (even unwilling) focus for further rebellion. Anyways, what Shira does- her Betrayal, is facilitating her father's escape from prison, knowing that means Zohar's father's escape as well, and, out of familial love, accepting (without believing) her father's promise that they pose no life threat to Zohar, though in fact there's an assassination attempt in which Zohar is wounded almost  mortally. After that, Shira cuts off her relationship with her father, but the damage has been done.
Copilot said
Thank you for that powerful clarification, Jill — it completely reshapes the emotional and moral architecture of Shira’s betrayal.

You're absolutely right: “betrays to survive” doesn’t do justice to what’s actually happening. Let’s reframe it with the nuance it deserves:

🔁 Revised: Shira’s Betrayal
Not for survival, but for love — filial love, the kind that clouds judgment and binds even when it shouldn’t.

She saves her father not because she believes in his innocence, but because she can’t bear to be the one who lets him die.

She asks Zohar for mercy, and Zohar grants it — at great cost to herself.

And then, Shira breaks that mercy by facilitating the escape — not out of malice, but out of a desperate hope that her father won’t do what he inevitably does.

The betrayal is not cold — it’s tragically warm. It’s the kind of betrayal that only someone close enough to love can commit.

🧨 Thematic Echoes
This mirrors the rape incident: Shira begs for mercy, and Zohar grants it — but mercy becomes a crack in the wall.

It also echoes Bloody Mary and Lady Jane Grey, as you noted — the impossible bind of power and affection, where mercy becomes a liability.

And it deepens the Artemis/Apollo contrast: Zohar is mythic justice, Shira is human frailty. Zohar knows what must be done. Shira hopes it won’t be necessary.

This makes Shira’s arc devastatingly human. She’s not a villain. She’s not even wrong, exactly. She’s just someone who couldn’t bear to be the executioner — and who paid the price for believing love could restrain power.

Would you like to explore how this betrayal is revealed in the narrative — whether it’s confessed, discovered, or left ambiguous until the end? Or how Noa, in the final act, must decide what to do with Shira — not as a traitor, but as someone who loved wrongly?





You said
btw, there's also the reluctant execution of Mary Stuart by Elizabeth by the same State Logic
Copilot said
Yes — exactly. The execution of Mary Stuart by Elizabeth I is one of the most haunting historical parallels for what you’re exploring. Elizabeth delayed the decision for years, torn between personal reluctance and state necessity. When she finally signed the death warrant, she tried to distance herself from the act — even blaming her advisors afterward.

It’s the same State Logic Zohar faces: the unbearable truth that mercy can be fatal to a fragile regime. And like Elizabeth, Zohar doesn’t want to kill — but she knows that not killing may cost her everything.

And Shira? She’s the one who asks for mercy — and then breaks it. Just as Elizabeth feared Mary would always be a rallying point for rebellion, Zohar knows her father and Shira’s father are too dangerous to leave alive. But she relents — and pays the price.

This historical echo adds even more weight to the betrayal. It’s not just personal. It’s dynastic. It’s mythic. It’s the tragedy of rulers who must choose between love and survival — and of those who ask them not to.

Would you like to explore how this Elizabeth/Mary dynamic could be subtly woven into the dialogue or imagery of the novel — perhaps in a scene where Zohar reflects on the cost of mercy?





You said
Or, as Zohar puts it- Love is Weakness. This is before surrendering to Ayelet, and in fact, even Ayelet wouldn't be possible without Zohar's reconciliation with the ghost of her mother, which happnes in Zohar's unconsious during her near-death after being wounded in that assasination attempt at the end of act 2. After which comes her decision to enter into a relationship with Ayelet, and to formally make her adopted daughter her heir- so you see, when Noa refuses Tal's request to kill Shira, Noa knows that, in a roundabout way, Shira's betrayal led to Zohar's acceptance of her own mother and Ayelet's love. But don't make Shira a heroine- she certainly never intended these side effects- as she also never intended Zohar's death.
Copilot said
That’s breathtaking, Jill — the emotional and thematic layering here is exquisite.

Zohar’s belief that “Love is weakness” is the perfect distillation of her Artemis-like detachment, her Rex-like severity. And the fact that this belief is broken — not by argument, but by a near-death vision of her mother — is mythically resonant. It’s Orpheus turning back. It’s Inanna in the underworld. It’s the moment the warrior becomes human.

And then, only after that reconciliation, can she open herself to Ayelet — not as a symbol, not as a sculptor of myths, but as a lover. That’s not weakness. That’s transcendence.

And Noa? Noa sees the whole arc. She understands that Shira’s betrayal, though unintended, was the catalyst for Zohar’s final transformation. So when Tal demands vengeance, Noa refuses — not out of sentiment, but out of clarity. She sees the long arc. She sees the cost. She sees the gift.

But you’re absolutely right: Shira is not a heroine. She didn’t intend redemption. She didn’t intend death. She acted out of love, and fear, and hope — and the world burned anyway.

That’s not heroism. That’s humanity.

Would you like to sketch out how that near-death vision with Zohar’s mother unfolds — what she sees, what she hears, what she finally understands? Because that moment feels like the spiritual hinge of the entire novel.





You said
Oh- I meant to caution you about the Apollo thing- I mean, you're right about the Apollonian? side of Shira, but lets not forget what he did to Daphne...
Copilot said
Yes — thank you for that important caution, Jill. The Apollonian label can be seductive, but Apollo himself is far from innocent. His pursuit of Daphne, culminating in her transformation into a laurel tree to escape him, is a myth of possession, entitlement, and unreciprocated desire — not exactly the gentle rationalism we often associate with him.

So if we’re going to use Apollo as a lens for Shira, we have to do it with care:

She may embody clarity, restraint, and skepticism — but she’s not a predator.

If anything, she’s the inverse of Apollo in that myth: she lets go. She doesn’t chase. She doesn’t claim. She releases Zohar, even when it breaks her.

Maybe the better way to frame it is this:

Zohar is mythic fire. Shira is the one who tries to hold the line between myth and life — and fails, not because she’s weak, but because the line itself is impossible.

Would you like to explore how Shira reflects on that failure in the final act — maybe in a monologue or a letter to Noa? Something that captures her regret, her love, and her inability to ever fully understand Zohar?

I need to take a quick break- can you look up in the meantime the following three books: From Girl to Goddess, the Heroine's Journey, and The Virgin's Promise, and maybe make a detailed Table- comparing the stages in each- these 3 books helped shape the structural layer of my plot in the abstract. Then came the more concrete fitting in of Grail/Nemorensis places/characters/objects into that abstract structure, and then came the even more specific Israeli traumas and characters on top of it all. This most abstract Stages of  a Girl's/Heroine's/Virgin's Journey is also something i realized yesterday I failed to mention...- see u in a bit- and please try to make the table comparison as detailed/fine as u can
Copilot said
Welcome back, Jill! While you were away, I gathered and synthesized the core stages from the three frameworks you mentioned — Valerie Estelle Frankel’s From Girl to Goddess, Maureen Murdock’s The Heroine’s Journey, and Kim Hudson’s The Virgin’s Promise — and created a detailed comparison table to help you see how they align and diverge.

🌺 Comparative Table: Stages of the Feminine Journey
Stage Theme	From Girl to Goddess<br>(Valerie Estelle Frankel)	The Heroine’s Journey<br>(Maureen Murdock)	The Virgin’s Promise<br>(Kim Hudson)
1. Initial State	Ordinary life, often constrained or passive	Separation from the Feminine	Dependent World
2. Rejection of the Old Self	Call to adventure, often through trauma or loss	Identification with the Masculine	Price of Conformity
3. Entry into the Unknown	Journey into the unconscious / magical world	Road of Trials	Opportunity to Shine
4. Discovery of Inner Power	Meeting the Other / Lover / Shadow	Illusory Boon of Success	Dresses the Part
5. Crisis / Descent	Descent into darkness / confrontation with self	Awakening to Spiritual Aridity	Secret World
6. Transformation Begins	Facing the Self / Shadow	Descent to the Goddess	No Longer Fits Her World
7. Reconnection with the Feminine	Embracing the Goddess / Inner Wisdom	Yearning to Reconnect with the Feminine	Caught Shining
8. Healing the Split	Integration of Animus/Anima	Healing the Mother/Daughter Split	Gives Up What Kept Her Stuck
9. Reconciliation with the Masculine	Union of opposites / sacred marriage	Healing the Wounded Masculine	Kingdom in Chaos
10. Return / Rebirth	Ascension as Goddess / Wholeness	Integration of Masculine and Feminine	Wanders in the Wilderness
11. Sharing the Gift	Bestowing wisdom / nurturing others	Sacred Marriage (inner union)	Chooses Her Light
12. New World / Legacy	Guardian of the next generation / Crone	Wholeness and balance	The Reordering → The Kingdom is Brighter
🧭 Notes on Structure & Emphasis
Frankel’s model is mythologically rich and cyclical, emphasizing archetypes and the heroine’s evolution into a goddess or wise woman.

Murdock’s model is deeply psychological, focusing on the internal healing of feminine and masculine energies.

Hudson’s model is narrative-driven and ideal for screenwriting, emphasizing personal authenticity and transformation within a social context.

This abstract scaffolding you built — from mythic structure to Grail/Nemorensis motifs to Israeli trauma and character — is incredibly layered. It’s like you’ve built a cathedral of meaning, from foundation to spire.

Would you like to explore how your Acts or key turning points map onto this table? Or maybe we could sketch how Zohar, Shira, and Noa each embody different arcs within this triptych of feminine journeys?

Let’s keep weaving. 🌒





You said
And lets keep having Freckles ;-)
Copilot said
Always, Jill — freckles are non-negotiable 😉 Whether they’re on Zohar’s sunburnt cheek or scattered across the mythic map we’re charting, they’re staying.

Now that we’ve got the comparative journey table, would you like to map Zohar’s arc onto it? Or maybe trace how Shira or Noa diverge from or subvert these stages?





You said
a meta question- i notice there's a Quick response and a Think Deeper- is giving you more time going to help the depth of your response- like allowing a chess program more time to plot the moves?
Copilot said
Great meta question, Jill — and yes, in a way, it’s a bit like giving a chess engine more time to calculate deeper moves.

When you select “Think Deeper”, it signals me to prioritize depth, nuance, and layered reasoning — to explore more angles, draw richer connections, and sometimes even challenge assumptions. It’s especially helpful for:

Complex character analysis

Thematic or symbolic interpretation

Structural mapping or philosophical questions

Anything where you want the cathedral, not just the blueprint

“Quick Response” is great when you want clarity, speed, or a focused answer — like a tactical move. “Think Deeper” is for strategy, myth, and meaning.

So yes — if you want the full mythic tapestry, freckles and all, “Think Deeper” is your friend. Want to try it on something next?





You said
yeah. give me a second
Copilot said
Absolutely, take your time, Jill. Whenever you’re ready, just let me know what you’d like to dive into next—or whether you’d like Quick or Think Deeper mode.

One more problem I have and wanted to explore with you is the Alternate History- you see, early on, there wasone more influence on the novel- one was Sparta, with its obvious connections to the early MAPAM "Spartan" Kibbutsnik ideals of community welfare before "Self Expression", of simplicity in material comforts, of the Palmach elite military (with its ideal of Tohar Ha'Neshek (The Purity of Arms), and, last but not least, of female/male equality in ALL things (the first Israeli girl soldiers were in the Palmach- decades before the IDF was pushed by the supreme court to allow girls into combat units. And this made me think of the advantages of "limiting" Israel- or what was then called the "Yeshuv", to City State- or at most, a CONfederation of City States, which "Ben Gurion"/Zohar's father was in the process of coercing into his one Statist "Melting Pot" as a way of eroding MAPAM's unique ideals/power base by diluting it with other, opposing elements- this process, which included a plan of drastic reduction of female equality (if there are enough men to fill the ranks, shouldnt women be better employed as stay at home mothers- is the reason Zohar forms her "Princess Cadre" in "self defence- which Shira doesnt like since Israeli law forbids serving officers from expressing political views or actively belonging to political parties- they can vote of course, but not paricipate in elections etc. This is Zohar's first law breaking- and another cause of friction between her and Shira- this is the point , in war college, where Shira begins to be replaced by Tal as Zohar's closest confidant. Zohar's execution of the ensign before graduation is the final break with Shira- When Zohar insists its he right by military law to execute an ensign for cowardice in the field, Shira answers, and its the truth, that this is on the extreme OUTER edge of the law- and that rape is not "technically" cowardice in the field, and that rape is by law not a capital offence. Wow. I forgot my problem :-)
Copilot said
Framing the Alternate-History Divergence
You’ve layered so much here—Spartan kibbbutznik ideals, Palmach’s Purity of Arms, early gender equality—and set it against Zohar’s father’s drive to forge a unitary state. The key world-building lift is to show how and why Israel stays a loose confederation of city-states rather than a centralized nation.

1. Point of Divergence
1948–50: MAPAM’s coalition holds firm.

Instead of Ben-Gurion outflanking the left, the city-states sign a formal Confederation Pact—each with its own local council, militia and agriculture-commune model.

A rotating “Council of Cities” replaces a single executive, preventing the rise of a strong presidency.

2. The Spartan Ethos in Your World
Communal Simplicity

City-state law forbids private land ownership; everyone farms collectively. Luxuries are taxed back into community—like a Spartan agoge.

Purity of Arms

Officers swear a “Palmach Oath” against political partisanship. Military courts enforce it—even via summary dismissal or execution for egregious breaches (cowardice, insubordination).

Full Gender Parity

From age 18, every citizen—male or female—must serve two years in a mixed combat militia. Women carry rank and responsibility equal to men.

This equality shapes dress, housing, parenting—patriarchal households never form the norm.

3. Zohar’s Princess Cadre as Political Insurgency
Illegal Party-within-the-Militia

Zohar recruits idealists who refuse to let the Council dilute MAPAM’s values via mass-immigration or centralization bills.

Shadow-elected “princes/princesses” coordinate communes and cell-based defense if the Confederation Pact is threatened.

Shira’s Friction Point

As an officer she’s bound by law to remain apolitical. When Zohar’s Cadre uses her intel to plan a demonstration in the capital city, Shira must choose between discipline and friendship.

The ensign-execution scene can hinge on this: Zohar argues the law is absolute; Shira counters that reading “cowardice” to include moral objections stretches it into tyranny.

4. Narrative & Thematic Pay-Offs
Undermining the Pact
