So, a MAPAM princess (in fact, Zohar's mother Yael's marriage to the MAPAI "prince" was, in her sister's view, a "betrayal") who served in Zoahar's father goverment as Labor Minister (Labor often given to MAPAM), while Foreign affairs and defence kept by MAPAI for themselves.

Here’s a first pass at sketching Zohar’s Aunt—your earliest female role model and the spark of your Inciting Incident. I’ve given her a few name options; pick one that feels right, and we can deepen her profile and the moment that changes everything.

1. Name Suggestions
Aviva (“spring, renewal”)

Orli (“my light”)

Shani (“scarlet, precious”)

2. Title & Political Role
Born into a leading MAPAM family, she’s long been dubbed “the MAPAM Princess.”

Served as Labor Minister in Zohar’s father’s coalition government—MAPAM’s signature portfolio.

Oversaw worker protections, land‐use reform, and refugee resettlement—always pushing the Two‐States line.

3. Personality & Beliefs
Fiery idealist with a soft spot for the underdog (Palestinian sharecroppers, memory vestals, child refugees).

Deeply distrustful of Mapai realpolitik—sees her sister Yael’s marriage as a betrayal of the cause.

Teaches young Zohar about standing by your convictions, even when the party line shifts.

4. Relationship to Zohar
Zohar’s first mentor in both politics and ethics: taught her how to read statutes, run a debate, and—most crucially—ask “Who does this law leave behind?”

When Zohar was twelve, Aunt secretly brought her to a dilapidated village school where Palestinian children learned under candlelight—planting the first seeds of Z’s later reforms.

5. The Inciting Incident
The Moment: As Labor Minister, Aunt publicly resigns after the government green-lights a “seasonal labor” bill that re-enslaves thousands of Palestinians—wearing chains of state coercion under a humanitarian pretext.

The Fallout: Her resignation speech is televised; the MAPAI press brands her “naןve and irresponsible.”

Zohar’s Call: Watching Aunt’s tear-streaked face, Zohar realizes that “playing by the rules” will never free the oppressed—and vows that day to break the old system.

Next steps:

Lock in Aunt’s name.

Flesh out her resignation speech and the public reaction.

Show how that moment propels a teenage Zohar into her first act of rebellion.

wait- what do you know of Avraham Ofer?
Copilot said
Avraham Ofer was born Avraham Hirsch in 1922 in Chorostkףw, Poland, and emigrated with his family to Mandatory Palestine in 1933. He joined the Haganah in 1937, helped found Kibbutz Hamadia, and served as a lieutenant colonel building Israel’s navy during the 1948 War of Independence. Ofer entered politics via Mapai’s Young Leadership, held senior roles in agriculture and municipal government, and was elected to the Knesset in 1969 as part of the Alignment. In 1974 he was appointed Minister of Housing under Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a post he held until 19771
.

In November 1976 journalist Yigal Laviv of Haolam Hazeh brought forward allegations of embezzlement involving Ofer’s handling of Shikun Ovdim funds. Although an initial police review found the charges unsubstantiated, Attorney General Aharon Barak ordered a deeper inquiry after new testimony emerged. Facing mounting rumors of formal charges and fearing the toll on his reputation, Ofer took his own life on January 3, 1977, leaving a note proclaiming his innocence but saying he “did not have the strength to bear any more”1

Do you know where/how he commited suicide?
Copilot said
Avraham Ofer died by suicide on January 3, 1977. His body was discovered inside his car—a Volvo—parked on Tel Baruch Beach north of Tel Aviv. He had shot himself in the head with a .22-caliber revolver and left a note proclaiming his innocence while stating he “did not have the strength to bear any more.”1

Did you know later on there were a lot of suspicions the embezzeling was done by someone higher up in the goverement / MAPAI, and that Ofer was simply "thrown to the dogs" by MAPAI to cover up for the real embezzelers?
Copilot said
Yes. In the years after Ofer’s death, many in the Israeli press and political circles came to believe he’d been made the fall guy for a broader graft network. The most frequently cited figure is Asher Yadlin, Mapai’s pick for Governor of the Bank of Israel, who was later convicted in a parallel embezzlement affair. Critics argue that by zeroing in on Ofer—forcing a sensational public inquiry and then allowing him to face ruin alone—Mapai leaders shielded more senior players from scrutiny1

.

That narrative is still debated—no court ever proved Ofer innocent or formally tied higher-ups to the Shikun Ovdim funds—but the sense that he was “thrown to the dogs” remains a powerful part of his legacy.

Well, in our story, Yael is modeled after Ofer, also a kibbutznik, and the real embezeller is Shira's father, the Defence Minister, on behalf of Zohar's father, (not for personal greed but to finance his campaign for the "statist new deal".
Copilot said
The Yael–Shira’s Father Embezzlement Arc
Below is a roadmap for weaving your Avraham Ofer–inspired betrayal into the story’s Inciting Incident. We’ll define:

How the graft scheme works

Yael’s role and tragic downfall

Zohar’s awakening and call to action

Key emotional beats and narrative fallout

1. The Graft Scheme
Players • Shira’s Father, the Defence Minister (“General Ben-Ami”) • Zohar’s Father, the Statist Premier (“Premier Harel”)

Mechanism

Ben-Ami quietly diverts “emergency defense procurements”

Funds rerouted through shell contractors—never delivered to troops

Cash skimmed to bankroll Harel’s “Statist New Deal” campaign coffers

Cover-Up • Official audit buried under national-security pretext • Dissenters branded “weak on defense” or “traitors to the union”

2. Yael’s Rise and Fall
As Labor Minister • Yael champions honest budgets—unaware of the secret diversion in another ministry • Pushes a sweeping Workers’ Welfare Bill, runs a surplus

Discovery & Accusation • A whistleblowing auditor in the Defence Ministry leaks red‐flag reports to Yael • Harel’s allies frame the scandal as “Labor Ministry mismanagement”—Yael is named as the scapegoat

Downfall • Forced resignation in a televised session; her reputation is shredded by state-run media • Public humiliation echoes Avraham Ofer’s tragic end—Yael retreats to her kibbutz in disgrace

3. Zohar’s Inciting Moment
Witnessing Betrayal • Teenage Zohar watches Aunt Yael’s resignation speech, sees her mentor broken • Discovers her own father’s hand in the frame-up through a hidden dossier Yael passed her

Moral Fallout • Tal comforts Zohar in the empty chamber of state archives • Zohar vows: “No more silent loyalty. I will upend this rotten union.”

4. Emotional & Political Fallout
Family Rift • Yael’s relationship with her sister Yael’s marriage (“betrayal”) deepens—Zohar loses trust in both parents • Shira’s father’s duplicity strains Zohar–Shira bond, foreshadows their final break

Public Reverberations • MAPAM base erupts in outrage; some call for full audit of Defence budgets • Mapai/Mafdal coalition doubles down on security rhetoric, warning of “internal enemies”

Zohar’s Path Forward

Underground Inquiry: Begins collecting leaked documents on state graft

Princess Cadre Oath: First covert act—recruiting youths sworn to expose corruption

First Public Challenge: Confronts the cabinet with irrefutable evidence—sparks her revolution

Next Steps
Pin down exact phraseology of Yael’s resignation speech (echoing Ofer’s innocence plea).

Choose Yael’s ultimate fate: exile, suicide, or secret survival guiding Zohar from the shadows.

Map Zohar’s first strategic moves—how she converts personal rage into political action.

wait- u used (i say "used", but this was only on friday and saturday) to offer your opinion on the fittness or unfitness of the/an idea- and now i'm getting to the Inciting Incident
Copilot said
Here’s my take on your proposed Inciting Incident—Aunt Yael’s public scapegoating and Zohar’s moral awakening—and a few tweaks to sharpen its impact:

What’s Working
Personal Stakes Meet Politics Aunt Yael isn’t just a distant stateswoman; she’s Zohar’s earliest mentor. Her fall isn’t abstract—it cuts deep into Zohar’s sense of family, honor and justice.

Echo of Real History Mirroring Avraham Ofer’s tragedy gives the scene real-world weight. The betrayal-by-coalition underscores how “principle” is sacrificed for power.

Clear Catalyst Zohar’s witnessing of her aunt’s disgrace provides a visceral “point of no return.” It explains why she’ll risk everything to undo the system.

Potential Pitfalls
Too Many Moving Parts Simultaneous revelations—embezzlement, cover‐up, personal betrayal—can overwhelm. Make sure the audience can track: who framed Yael, why, and who Zohar will hold responsible.

Emotional Overload If Zohar absorbs all the outrage at once, her reaction risks feeling melodramatic. Let her grief and anger build in stages—first confusion, then righteous fury.

Lack of Agency Aunt Yael’s resignation is reactive. Consider giving her one proactive stand—perhaps a final parliamentary filibuster or an unsanctioned field visit to Palestinian laborers—that foreshadows Zohar’s own rebellion.

Suggestions to Strengthen It
Foreshadow the Frame‐Up Have Yael confide in Zohar days before about strange discrepancies in the Defence budget—small clues that later click into place.

Split the Big Reveal First we see Yael’s stunned, anguished resignation. Later, Zohar uncovers the forged documents in a shadowy archive scene, transforming heartbreak into cold determination.

Elevate Yael’s Final Stand Instead of a simple resignation speech, give Yael a moment of defiance—maybe she steps onto the Defense Ministry floor, rips off her ministerial pin, and hurls it at the podium before walking out.

Show Zohar’s First Rebellion Immediately afterward, have a younger Zohar break some minor regulation in Yael’s honor—refusing to salute her father in uniform, or leaking a sanitized version of Yael’s speech to a sympathetic newspaper.

Overall, this Inciting Incident has the emotional fuel and political resonance to launch Zohar’s arc. By pacing the revelations and giving both Yael and Zohar moments of agency, you’ll make their choices feel earned and their bond unforgettable.

How would you like to refine it next—focusing on Yael’s climactic speech, Zohar’s private discovery, or the immediate fallout in Zohar’s inner circle?





You said
no no- the Inciting Incident does not physically include Yael- wait- don't say anything, and let me tell you about it- when I write "done", then please offer your comments, ok?
Copilot said
Got it—I'll wait quietly until you write "done." Take your time.





You said
So, Yael, once she understands her role as "fall guy", and the intensity of the MAPAI whispering campaign against her, feels she can no longer "bear it",  and decides on two things, Second: she will (like Ofer) kill herself but maintain her innocence, but first, she writes to Zohar (who's now the heroine of the Yom Kippur front, and asks her to formlly adopt Noa as her "daughter" (although Zohar at the time is in her early twenties, and Noa is maybe 12) if anything should happen to her- I mean Yael. Zohar writes from the front and promises to do so. Then comes the suicide- in fact, I think it will stay an open question whether it WAS a suicide, or a MAPAI "assisted suicide".  Then comes the ceasefire, and Zohar hears that her aunt has died, and that her father plans to publically, after her aunt's state funeral, to adopt Noa (not out of love, of course, but to gain public sympathy on the one hand, and to snuf out any chance that through education and social miliu Noa will become a new MAPAM princess. Zohar (with the Princess Cadre) rush riding to the city, and during the funeral, Zohar walks (in uniform, and armed), onto the "officals" platform, with Yael's letter, and knowing this will precipitate a confrontation which her father would be loath  to have in public against the new war heroine, she gives Yael's letter to Noa, and claims Noa as her "legal" guardian. THIS, is the Inciting Incident.
Copilot said
Thank you for laying that out. Here's my take:

🔥 This Is a Brilliant Inciting Incident
It’s not just emotionally charged—it’s politically explosive, morally complex, and deeply personal. It does everything an inciting incident should:

✅ Stakes Are Personal and Political
Zohar isn’t just reacting to a death—she’s stepping into a legacy. The moment she claims Noa, she’s also claiming MAPAM’s abandoned ideals and setting herself in direct opposition to her father’s regime.

✅ It’s a Public Act of Defiance
Doing it at the funeral, in uniform, in front of the entire political elite? That’s mythic. It’s Joan of Arc meets Antigone meets David facing Goliath—with a letter instead of a sling.

✅ It’s Legally and Symbolically Loaded
The letter is a will, a confession, a political manifesto. Noa becomes both a child and a symbol—of inheritance, of resistance, of the future Zohar is now sworn to protect.

✅ It Forces the Plot Forward
This can’t be walked back. Zohar has made her break. Her father must now either retaliate or retreat. The Princess Cadre becomes more than a gesture—it’s a faction.

💡 A Few Refinement Suggestions
The Letter: Consider letting the audience hear it in full—either as a voiceover or read aloud by Noa. It should be equal parts love letter, political testament, and moral indictment.

The Funeral Setting: Use the setting to heighten tension. Maybe it’s at Mount Herzl, with military honor guards, and the crowd is split—some cheer Zohar, others are stunned into silence.

Noa’s Reaction: Let her be more than a passive recipient. Maybe she’s the one who reads the letter aloud, trembling but defiant. That’s the moment she becomes Zohar’s daughter in spirit, not just in law.

The Father’s Response: He doesn’t need to lash out—his silence, his forced smile, his retreat from the podium could say everything. Let him lose the crowd without a word.

This is the kind of inciting incident that reshapes the world. It’s not just the start of Zohar’s rebellion—it’s the moment the old order begins to crack.

Would you like to sketch the scene itself next? Or explore how each narrator (Tal, Shira, Ayelet, Noa) remembers or interprets this moment later in the book?

Your "Few Refinement Suggestions" are very good :-) let me fill you up on one last detail, though- Unknown to Zohar, the Child Noa has been (perhaps understandably) jealous of Zohar's relationship with Yael. Zohar is like an older sister, but also like  Yael's favorite daughter. So the beginning of their relationship will be rocky, and at one point, after the coup, Noa will "run away from home"- it will take time for them to build a mother/daughter relationship, and even more time for Noa to accept freely the Torch Zohar will want to pass to her- but that's in the future. I agree with "letting the audience hear it in  full", and I agree with not making Noa too "passive".
Copilot said
That added detail about Noa’s jealousy is perfect. It deepens the emotional realism and prevents the Inciting Incident from feeling too clean or mythic. Here's how that nuance can enrich the scene and the arc that follows:

🔄 Emotional Undercurrent: Noa’s Jealousy
Before the Funeral: Noa has always seen Zohar as the golden one—Yael’s “real” daughter in spirit. She’s grieving her mother, but also quietly resents that Zohar is the one everyone turns to.

At the Funeral: When Zohar steps forward, Noa’s reaction is complex—part awe, part anger, part confusion. She may even hesitate before accepting the letter.

Aftermath: Noa doesn’t instantly become Zohar’s daughter. She may go with her, but she’s sullen, guarded, and lashes out. Her “running away” later becomes a natural extension of this unresolved grief and rivalry.

🔥 Scene Enhancement: The Funeral
Let’s imagine the moment with this new emotional layer:

As Zohar steps onto the platform, the crowd hushes. She’s in full uniform, medals still dusty from the front. She doesn’t salute. She doesn’t bow. She walks straight to Noa—twelve, pale, clutching her mother’s scarf—and kneels.

“This is yours,” Zohar says, holding out the letter. “Your mother’s last words.”

Noa doesn’t take it. Not at first. She stares at Zohar, eyes brimming—not with tears, but with something harder.

“Why you?” she whispers.

Zohar doesn’t answer. She just places the letter in Noa’s lap, stands, and turns to the crowd.

“I am her guardian now. By her will. And by mine.”

Behind her, Noa unfolds the letter. Her voice, when she begins to read, is small—but it carries.

🌱 Long-Term Payoff
This rocky start makes their eventual bond earned. Noa’s arc becomes not just about inheriting Zohar’s torch, but about choosing to love the woman she once resented. That’s powerful.

Would you like to draft the full text of Yael’s letter next? Or sketch Noa’s “running away” moment and what brings her back?

wait - I'll have to take a short break- and when I come back I want to tell you something related to the Inciting Incident- something that almost became the Inciting Incident, something that happened on Zohar's (and Shira's and Tal's) war college graduation Day, but on which occasion Zohar decided it was too soon- she hadn't the war heroine star power yet, and the conflict was not yet of the right  calibre. So, hang on for a bit...
