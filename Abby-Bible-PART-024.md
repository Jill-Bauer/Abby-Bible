Is there no way for each Character/Action/Object/Place to be in its own cell?
Copilot said
Here’s a way to give each item its own cell by breaking the big matrix into four separate tables—one for each category—with each row holding a single item per myth/romance/novel column.

can you clear the cells holding, for example, Charaters 2, 3, and 4, and rename Charaters 1 as simply Characters (and the same for objects, places, etc?

You said
Voila! :-)
Copilot said
Great! We’ve got your multi-layer mapping table neatly formatted. What’s our next step? Would you like to start populating those final missing cells in the Zoharian column, or refine any of the labels?





You said
well, now i'll ask you to help with specific cells. For example: there are various accounts of the Chapel Perilous (in Malory, in the French versions, in Bleharis, in the Gawain, etc- could you try and get the details of all the variants about the Chapel Perilous?
Copilot said
Below is a focused survey of the main medieval variants of the Chapel Perilous, drawn from key sources.

Sir Thomas Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur (c. 1485)1

Setting: A small, enchanted chapel deep in the forest, ruled by the sorceress Hellawes of Castle Nygramous.

Peril: Hellawes attempts to seduce and entrap Sir Lancelot within its walls. His trial is one of chastity and resolve rather than combat.

Outcome: Lancelot resists her enchantments and escapes, but the episode underscores the chapel’s function as a test of knightly virtue.

French Prose Cycles (“Atre Perilleus” / L’גtre pיrilleux, 13th c.)2

Setting: Often called “The Perilous Graveyard,” this chapel stands amid tombs.

Peril: A knight (initially unnamed, later grafted onto Gawain’s cycle) must spend the night and confront a woman bound by a devil’s curse.

Outcome: The hero slays or forces off the devil, liberating the victim and proving his prowess. The prose versions tend to downplay the magic in favor of a more conventional martial adventure.

Jessie L. Weston’s From Ritual to Romance (1920) / “Bleharis” discussion3

Interpretation: Weston treats the Perilous Chapel as an echo of the Rex Nemorensis rite—a fertility‐through‐sacrifice motif—transformed into a “dangerous enclosure” that tests the hero’s worthiness.

Emphasis: The chapel becomes a locus where death and rebirth themes mingle, but in the romance it is reframed as a redemptive quest rather than a recurring sacrificial ritual.

Pantheon.org summary (“Perilous Chapel”)4

Plot variant: Sir Meliot de Logres, mortally wounded, can only be healed with a piece of his shroud kept in the Perilous Chapel.

Peril: The chapel is guarded by Hellawas (Hellawes) the sorceress, and retrieving the shroud requires both martial skill and moral courage.

Outcome: A knight (often Lancelot) braves the chapel’s enchantments to rescue and heal Meliot, reinforcing the Grail‐quest’s healing dimension.

Together, these versions show the Chapel Perilous shifting from a locus of dark seduction (Malory) through a knightly graveyard ordeal (French prose), into a symbolic crucible of death → renewal (Weston/Bleharis), and finally as a sanctified trial whose completion restores life (Grail‐quest summaries).

You said
not bad :-) does any of the versions mention Freckles or Racoon eyeliners? :-)
Copilot said
None of the medieval tales ever pause to note freckles—or raccoon-style kohl! Their perilous chapels are stocked with sorcery and enchanted traps, but no beauty counters.

If you want to inject a dash of modern glam into your own Chapel Perilous—say, cursed eyeliner that smudges into prophetic runes—we can brainstorm how that might deepen the ritual’s symbolism. Or shall we turn next to filling in those vacant Zoharian cells?





You said
no no- just kidding. what I wanted to ask is how does all of this relate (do you think) to our own Grail Knight (Zohar) and our Grail Maiden (Ayelet) and to the "Mating" ritual Zohar rejects, on the one hand, and to the disastrous marriage of the "former" Grail Knight (Zohar's father) and the former Grail Maiden (Zohar's mother).
Copilot said
Linking the Chapel Perilous to Zohar, Ayelet, and the Mating Ritual
Zohar as Grail Knight
Zohar embodies the knight who must pass the perilous test without succumbing to seduction or despair. Like Lancelot in Malory’s chapel, she confronts a demand for consummation—political, personal, or sexual—and refuses it, preserving her autonomy and the integrity of her quest.
